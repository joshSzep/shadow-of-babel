### Personal Connection

The maiden voyage of the Babel Elevator begins on **August 4th, 2085**—my 100th birthday.

This date anchors the story in a specific future while connecting it to a personal milestone. The novel imagines what humanity might build in the next sixty years, and whether we'll have learned to build it justly.
