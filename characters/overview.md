# Character Overview

## POV Philosophy

The novel uses multiple POV characters to refract the themes of **awe** and **shadow** through different relationships with the elevator and what it represents. Each character embodies a different answer to the central questions:

- Who owns the future when the future is above the sky?
- Does ambition justify inequality?
- What do people see when they rise above their world?

## Ensemble Dynamics

- Zara is traveling on a scholarship funded by Henrik's company
- Amara has interviewed Miriam before; has files on Henrik
- All five will be in the same space at key moments
- Their paths cross naturally through the climber's structure

- Yusuf and Zara: Different generations, different access points
- Amara: The observer who becomes participant
- Each sees the others through their own lens

## Writing Notes

- Each POV should have a distinct voice and rhythm
- Chapters alternate between POVs, not strictly rotating
- Some moments seen from multiple perspectives (key scenes)
- Interior monologue varies by character: Miriam is analytical, Yusuf is visceral, Zara is questioning, Henrik is justifying, Amara is observational
- All five are sympathetic; none are villains; all are compromised
