## Background

### Early Life
- Born and raised in Hackney, East London
- Father: second-generation Nigerian-British, works in transport logistics
- Mother: first-generation Chinese-British, runs a small restaurant
- Working-class household, fiercely pro-education
- Scholarship kid from primary school onward
- Always the smartest in the room; learned to hide it, then stopped hiding

### Education
- State school, then scholarship to a private sixth form
- First in her family to university: physics at Imperial
- Excelled despite (because of?) being underestimated
- Research focus: orbital mechanics and tether dynamics
- Caught the attention of the Stellar Foundation scholarship program

### The Scholarship
- Stellar Industries funds "Orbital Studies" scholarships
- Provides full funding, mentorship, and—the prize—passage to orbit
- Zara is one of twelve recipients globally
- She knows it's partly PR. She took it anyway.
- "They can use me for their image; I'll use them for access."

### What She's Leaving
- Parents proud but worried; the elevator feels dangerous
- Younger brother idolizes her; she's setting a path
- Friends from home: some supportive, some call her a sellout
- A relationship ended when she chose this
- London is home; orbit is the future

## Psychology

### Core Traits
- Intellectually fearless; asks the questions others avoid
- Empathetic but sometimes blind to her own privileges
- Hungry—for knowledge, experience, recognition
- Self-aware about her role as symbol; resents and exploits it
- Idealistic but learning to be strategic
- Laughs when uncomfortable; it disarms and deflects

### Internal Conflicts
- **Gratitude vs. Resentment:** The scholarship opened doors; it also has strings
- **Ambition vs. Integrity:** How much will she compromise to rise?
- **Belonging vs. Outsider:** Not fully part of any world she inhabits
- **Seeing vs. Being Seen:** She wants to observe orbit; she's been brought to be observed

### Fears
- That she's a token, not a talent
- That she'll get to orbit and find it empty of meaning
- That she's abandoning her community for an elite one
- That she's not as smart as she needs to be

### Hopes
- To do real science, not performative diversity
- To see Earth from above—the physicist's dream
- To come back and open doors for others
- To figure out who she is apart from expectations

## Relationships

### Family
- **Dad (Emeka):** Quietly proud, gives practical advice, texts every day
- **Mum (Lily):** Expressive worry and support; sends care packages
- **Brother (Marcus, 16):** Demanding updates; making her document everything

### The Scholarship Cohort
- Twelve students from around the world
- Instant bond; also instant competition
- Some resentful of each other; others form real friendships
- They know they're being used; they're in it together

### On the Climber
- Housed with other scholarship students (not VIP, not economy)
- Orbits between worlds: invited to corporate events, drawn to workers
- Finds Miriam fascinating—the engineer who made this possible
- Suspicious of Henrik's charm offensive toward students
- Amara interviews her; the conversation is unexpectedly affecting

### The Mentorship Question
- Assigned a Stellar Industries mentor: a mid-level executive
- The relationship is awkward; corporate culture is alien
- She seeks out Miriam for real mentorship
- The question of who guides her matters

## The Maiden Voyage Arc

### Act I: Boarding
- Arrives with the scholarship cohort; carefully managed PR moments
- Photos at the terminal; she smiles on cue, seethes inside
- First sight of the tether: the physics made real
- Boards the climber; sees the class divisions immediately
- Her cabin is middle-tier: symbolic of her in-between status

### Act II: Early Ascent
- The physics of the ascent fascinates her—she's taking notes
- Attends a corporate reception; feels like decoration
- Escapes to observation deck; finds quiet and stars
- Encounters other passengers; starts to see the human story
- First doubts about the scholarship—what is she endorsing?

### Act III: Mid-Ascent
- Interview with Amara turns into real conversation
- Seeks out Miriam; the mentorship begins
- Attends a workers' event (invited by a sympathetic crew member)
- Sees Yusuf; doesn't know his story yet, but senses it
- A corporate event goes wrong; she witnesses Henrik's world

### Act IV: High Altitude
- The overview effect hits her hard—tears, silence, awe
- Long conversation with Miriam about creation and responsibility
- Confronts her Stellar mentor about the scholarship's purpose
- Realizes she's being positioned for a role she didn't choose
- Decides to push back—but how, and at what cost?

### Act V: Arrival
- The orbital hub: the future she's supposedly inheriting
- Explores, questions, documents
- A moment with the scholarship cohort: they're all processing
- Decision point: Does she stay in the program? Speak out? Strategize?
- Final reflection: The journey changed her; now what?

## Voice and Style

### Interior Monologue
- Quick, curious, self-questioning
- Scientific observation mixed with emotional response
- Code-switches mentally between home and academic registers
- Catches herself performing; interrogates it
- Humor as defense mechanism; sincerity breaking through

### Dialogue
- Adapts speech to context: formal with executives, relaxed with peers
- Asks direct questions that make people uncomfortable
- Listens actively; remembers details
- Can be sharp when provoked
- Genuine when she trusts

### Sample Internal Passage

*The scholarship brochure said "Reaching for the Stars Together." The photo showed a diverse group of smiling students, hands raised toward a stylized elevator. Zara was in that photo now, wearing the smile she'd practiced in the mirror. Diverse: check. Smiling: check. Together: debatable. She was reaching, all right—for something the brochure never mentioned. Understanding. Not just the physics of the tether, but the physics of who got to climb it and why she was one of them.*

## Key Scenes to Write

1. **The scholarship selection moment (flashback)**: What she felt and what she hid
2. **The PR photo session**: Smiling through her discomfort
3. **First observation deck visit**: The physics and the feeling
4. **The corporate reception**: Decoration among the powerful
5. **Interview with Amara**: Two outsiders recognizing each other
6. **The conversation with Miriam**: Mentorship and warnings
7. **Witnessing the class divide**: A moment that crystallizes her position
8. **The confrontation with her program**: Pushing back at last
9. **The overview effect**: Everything she knows, tiny and precious

## Thematic Role

Zara represents the **exception** that tests the rule: the working-class kid who got access, the proof that the system works—or the demonstration that it only works for the useful few.

Her journey asks:
- Is it compromise to accept what's offered?
- Can you change a system from inside it?
- What do you owe to those who didn't get your chance?
- When the door opens for you, who do you hold it for?

She is the promise of meritocracy. The question is whether the promise is real—and whether she'll demand that it become so.
