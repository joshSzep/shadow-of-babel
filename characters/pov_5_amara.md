- First documentary: mining companies and displacement
- Won awards; made enemies; kept going

**The Babel Beat**
- Assigned to the elevator story eight years ago
- Covered construction, worker conditions, Consortium politics

**The Maiden Voyage Assignment**
- Hand-picked for embedded access
- A career milestone—but with strings

- She wants the truth, whatever that costs

### Personal Life

## Psychology

### Core Traits
- Incisive, relentless, patient
- Compassionate but compartmentalized
- Knows how to wait for the story to reveal itself
- Ethical within her own code, which isn't everyone's
- Lonelier than she admits
- Believes in journalism even when journalism disappoints

### Internal Conflicts
- **Access vs. Truth:** Can she tell the real story without losing her seat at the table?
- **Observer vs. Participant:** She's on the climber, but is she of it?
- **Mother vs. Correspondent:** Her daughter is growing up on screens
- **Career vs. Purpose:** Is she chasing stories or meaning?

### The Journalist's Dilemma
- She has access others would kill for
- The price is implied: don't bite the hand
- She's always navigating: What can she report? What must she hold?
- The maiden voyage will force a choice

### Fears
- Missing the story that matters
- Becoming what she covers: complicit, comfortable
- Her daughter not knowing her
- Dying like her mother, with work unfinished

### Hopes
- To produce something lasting: truth, not just coverage
- To model integrity for Aïssatou
- To see what she's spent years covering from the inside
- To understand if she's still the journalist she meant to be

## Relationships

### Family
- **Aïssatou:** Her compass; every decision weighed against this child
- **Mother (Ndèye):** Dying of cancer; their relationship is complicated but deep
- **Father (Ousmane):** Deceased; his exile shaped her politics
- **Sister (Mariama):** Cares for their mother; resentments and love

### Professional
- Trusted by sources across the access spectrum
- Respected by colleagues; envied by some
- Her editor (James) supports her but has limits
- Consortium PR (Daniela) is her handler/adversary

### On the Climber
- Has a press room and shared cabin
- Fellow journalists are competitors and collaborators
- Targets for interviews: Miriam, Henrik, Zara, workers, lottery winners
- Observes everyone; everyone observes her observing
- The question: what will she do with what she sees?

### Interview Dynamics
- **With Miriam:** History between them; this interview goes deeper
- **With Henrik:** He's controlled her access before; now she's in his space
- **With Zara:** Unexpected connection; two outsiders with different access
- **With Yusuf:** The interview he doesn't want to give; the story she needs

## The Maiden Voyage Arc

### Act I: Boarding
- Final calls to her daughter, her mother, her editor
- Passes through press credentials; different line, same scrutiny
- The press room: her colleagues, her competition
- First observations: the terminal, the classes, the tether
- She's recording everything—mentally and digitally

### Act II: Early Ascent
- Standard coverage: the awe, the spectacle, the official narrative
- Interviews with lottery winners, dignitaries—surface stuff
- Sees the class divisions; notes, but doesn't report yet
- Connects with Zara; something unexpected opens
- First hints that this voyage has undercurrents

### Act III: Mid-Ascent
- The Miriam interview: the version for broadcast, and the conversation off-record
- Pursues the worker angle; meets resistance
- Learns about Yusuf—this is the story, she realizes
- The Henrik interview: he thinks he's controlling it; she's gathering
- Tension with Consortium PR: how far can she push?

### Act IV: High Altitude
- Yusuf agrees to talk—or she finds him anyway
- The interview is different: raw, real, unmanaged
- She has footage, testimony, a story that matters
- Dilemma: Report now and lose access? Or wait?
- Her own overview moment: Earth below, her life's work above

### Act V: Arrival
- The orbital hub: the future she's been documenting
- Files her official coverage: accurate, careful, incomplete
- Holds the real story for something bigger
- Video call with Aïssatou from orbit—the moment that matters
- Resolution: She knows what she'll do; we don't, yet

## Voice and Style

### Interior Monologue
- Observational, precise, layered
- Notes details others miss: body language, word choices, silence
- Analytical but not cold; compassion leaks through
- Self-critical; she knows her compromises
- The professional voice and the personal voice in tension

### Dialogue
- Interviews: warm, disarming, then pointed
- With colleagues: clipped, competitive, collegial
- With sources: trusted, careful, persistent
- With Aïssatou: tender, raw, the self she protects elsewhere
- With herself: the questions she can't ask out loud

### Sample Internal Passage

*Amara had learned to count silences. In interview rooms, in press conferences, in the space between question and answer. The silences told you what the words concealed. Now, watching Henrik Lindqvist adjust his cuff before responding to a question about worker conditions, she counted: one second, two. The adjustment was unconscious, but the pause was not. He was deciding what truth could be afforded. She noted the pause in her shorthand. Later, in the edit bay, someone would cut it. But she would remember.*

## Key Scenes to Write

1. **The departure calls**: Aïssatou, mother, editor—what she carries
2. **The press room**: Her world, her competitors, her constraints
3. **The official coverage**: What she files vs. what she sees
4. **The Zara interview**: Connection across difference
5. **The Miriam interview**: History, honesty, the off-record moment
6. **The Henrik interview**: Cat and mouse
7. **Finding Yusuf**: The story she's been looking for
8. **The Yusuf interview**: Truth, raw and unmanageable
9. **The dilemma**: What to report, when, at what cost
10. **The call from orbit**: Aïssatou's face, the view of Earth, the self laid bare

## Thematic Role

Amara represents the **witness**: the one who stands between event and audience, shaping what the world will see. She carries the question of whether observation is ever neutral—and what obligation comes with the power to tell.

Her journey asks:
- What is the story, and who decides?
- Can truth survive access?
- What do we owe the stories we tell?
- Is watching the same as understanding?

She is the lens through which Babel reaches the world. The question is whether the lens distorts—and whether she can bear to show what she truly sees.
