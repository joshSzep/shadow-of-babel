- Never knew want; understood it as an abstraction

## Psychology

### Core Traits
- Charismatic, genuinely intelligent, strategically generous
- Believes in progress and his role in creating it
- Avoids conflict through charm, then dominates when charm fails
- Compassionate in theory; insulated from suffering in practice
- Genuinely doesn't see himself as the villain
- Curious about people—as phenomena, not always as equals

### Internal Conflicts
- **Visionary vs. Profiteer:** Is he building the future or extracting from it?
- **Father vs. Son:** Living up to his father's legacy, or escaping it?
- **Cosmopolitan vs. Rootless:** Belongs everywhere; connects nowhere
- **Seen vs. Seeing:** He's observed constantly; does he truly observe others?

### Blind Spots
- Believes meritocracy is real because he's never examined his own path
- Sees workers' grievances as unfortunate but inevitable
- Thinks philanthropy balances extraction
- Assumes his perspective is objective
- Genuinely confused when people don't want what he's offering

### What Could Change Him
- Being truly seen—not as a symbol, but as a person with choices
- Encountering someone he can't charm or dismiss
- Facing a cost he can't pay his way out of
- The overview effect, if he lets it in

## Relationships

### Family
- **Father (Sven):** Stroke survivor; still sharp, still judging from Stockholm
- **Mother (Ingrid):** The family diplomat; manages image
- **Ex-wife (Clara):** Bitter but bound by children
- **Children (Astrid, Erik):** He loves them; they're growing up strangers
- **Current wife (Mei-Ling):** Partner in strategy; affection, but is it love?

### Professional
- Board members he flatters and controls
- Consortium executives he negotiates with
- Competitors he respects or destroys
- Employees who admire or fear him

### On the Climber
- Traveling with a small corporate retinue
- Schmoozing politicians, investors, press
- The scholarship students are his company's PR project
- Sees Zara as a success story he funded
- Sees Miriam as legacy to be associated with
- Yusuf is invisible to him—at first

## The Maiden Voyage Arc

### Act I: Boarding
- Arrives by private transport; escorted through VIP channels
- The anchor city is backdrop; he's seen it from helicopters
- Press conferences, photo ops, handshakes
- Boards the luxury tier; the climber is partly his company's design
- First glass of champagne before the tether clears the terminal

### Act II: Early Ascent
- Business as usual: meetings, calls, negotiations
- The view is beautiful; he notes it, schedules time to appreciate it
- Mixed-class event: performs graciousness
- Encounters Zara; pleased with his investment
- First hints that this voyage is more complicated than PR

### Act III: Mid-Ascent
- Amara requests an interview; he agrees (always control the narrative)
- The interview goes differently than expected; she pushes
- Encounters workers in a chance meeting; something nags at him
- Learns about Yusuf—specifically, his history
- A business crisis from Earth reaches him; his response reveals priorities

### Act IV: High Altitude
- The overview effect: Earth below, everything he owns a speck
- A moment of genuine reflection—what is he building? For whom?
- Seeks out Miriam; a conversation about legacy
- Confronts (or is confronted by) someone who doesn't see him as benevolent
- A choice point: double down on who he's been, or crack open

### Act V: Arrival
- The orbital hub: his second home, his future kingdom
- Business resumes, but something has shifted
- Final conversation with Zara: does he see her differently now?
- Returns to his world, but carrying questions
- The ambiguity: changed, or just temporarily unsettled?

## Voice and Style

### Interior Monologue
- Smooth, confident, self-narrating as a protagonist
- Occasionally undercut by doubts he quickly suppresses
- Thinks in terms of strategy, optimization, returns
- Moments of genuine aesthetic appreciation
- The practiced self slipping, revealing something rawer

### Dialogue
- Fluent, charming, adaptable to any audience
- Uses questions to control conversations
- Can be genuinely curious or strategically curious
- Rare flashes of unguarded honesty
- When challenged: smooth deflection, or cold precision

### Sample Internal Passage

*The elevator was Henrik's inheritance made visible: a line from Earth to the future his family had helped finance. Forty years of vision and capital, rising through the atmosphere. The brochures talked about humanity's triumph, species-level achievement. True enough. Also true: Lindqvist Orbital held seventeen percent of the cargo contracts and a board seat on the hub's governing council. Humanity's triumph had excellent quarterly projections.*

## Thematic Role

Henrik represents the **beneficiary**: those who gain from systems they didn't create but perpetuate. He is not a villain—he is something more challenging: a decent person inside an indecent structure.

His journey asks:
- Can you benefit from injustice without being unjust?
- What does responsibility look like at the top?
- Is vision enough, or does it matter whose vision?
- Can privilege be wielded for change, or only for more privilege?

He is the future's owner. The question is whether ownership is the right metaphor—and whether he can imagine another.
