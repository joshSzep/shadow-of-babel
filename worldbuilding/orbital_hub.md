# The Orbital Hub

## Overview

At 36,000 kilometers above Earth, where the elevator's tether terminates, humanity has constructed its first permanent gateway to the cosmos. The Orbital Hub is a luminous halo floating in the void—part port, part city, part industrial complex, part dream made manifest.

## Physical Structure

### The Terminus Ring
- The central structure where climbers arrive and depart
- A massive rotating ring providing artificial gravity (0.3–0.5g in most sections)
- Docking bays for climbers, shuttles, and orbital craft
- The "first step" into space for most passengers

### The Habitat Spokes
- Extending from the terminus, residential and commercial modules
- Variable gravity zones (rotating sections vs. microgravity cores)
- Corporate enclaves, diplomatic quarters, worker dormitories
- The wealthy live in the "high-gravity" luxury sections
- Workers often endure microgravity zones with health consequences

### The Industrial Outer Ring
- Manufacturing facilities taking advantage of vacuum and microgravity
- Solar collection arrays stretching kilometers
- Raw material processing from asteroid mining operations
- Restricted access; mostly automated, some human oversight

### The Dry Dock
- Shipyard for orbital and interplanetary vessels
- Where humanity's deep-space ambitions take physical form
- Construction crews work in shifts, rarely returning to Earth
- The skeleton of a Mars transport is always visible, always unfinished

## The View

### Earth Below
- A blue marble, heartbreakingly beautiful
- Weather systems visible as swirling patterns
- Night side glitters with city lights
- The tether descends like a thread into the atmosphere
- From here, national borders are invisible; inequality is invisible
- The view is weaponized by propagandists: "See? We are one."

### The Stars
- Unfiltered by atmosphere, the stars do not twinkle
- The Milky Way is a river of light
- Passengers often weep at first sight
- Some cannot look; the void is too vast

### The Sun
- Blindingly intense; viewing ports auto-dim
- Solar flare warnings are routine
- Radiation shielding is omnipresent
- The hub rotates to manage thermal loads

## Population

### Permanent Residents (~50,000)
- Station operations crew
- Corporate employees on long-term contracts
- Scientists and researchers
- Service workers (often trapped by debt)
- Children born in orbit (a new generation with no homeland)

### Transient Population (~5,000–20,000)
- Tourists on expensive packages
- Business travelers
- Diplomats and politicians
- Workers rotating through contracts
- The rare lottery winners

### The Orbital Elite
- Those wealthy enough to own property in space
- Some have not returned to Earth in years
- They see themselves as post-national, post-terrestrial
- Rumors of life extension research, genetic modification
- "The gravity of Earth is for those who cannot escape it"

---

## Economy

### Industries
- **Microgravity manufacturing**: Perfect crystals, exotic alloys, pharmaceuticals
- **Solar energy**: Beamed to Earth or stored for orbital use
- **Asteroid processing**: Raw materials from captured near-Earth objects
- **Shipbuilding**: The next generation of spacecraft
- **Tourism**: Expensive, exclusive, highly curated

### Currency and Trade
- Orbital credits partially decoupled from Earth currencies
- Corporate scrip common in some sectors
- Black markets exist even here
- Water and air are more valuable than gold

### Labor Conditions
- Contracts often exploitative
- Returning to Earth is expensive; many workers are effectively trapped
- Health effects of long-term microgravity create dependencies
- Unionization efforts are suppressed
- "Orbital freedom" means freedom for capital, not workers

---

## Governance

### The Consortium
- A coalition of corporations, nations, and international bodies
- Nominally democratic; effectively plutocratic
- Jurisdictional disputes are constant
- Earth governments have limited authority
- "In orbit, sovereignty is negotiable"

### Security
- Private security forces loyal to corporate interests
- International peacekeeping contingent (underfunded, symbolic)
- Surveillance is total
- Airlocks can be locked remotely
- The ultimate threat: decompression

### Legal Gray Zones
- Crimes committed in orbit: whose law applies?
- Extradition treaties are incomplete
- Some come to orbit to escape Earth's justice
- Others discover orbit has no justice at all

---

## Daily Life

### Routine
- Circadian lighting mimics Earth day cycles
- Mandatory exercise to counter bone and muscle loss
- Communal meals in rotating mess halls
- Recreation limited but creative (zero-g sports, VR, observation lounges)
- Religious services adapted to the environment

### Health
- Radiation exposure carefully monitored
- Bone density treatments required for long stays
- Psychological support for "overview effect" and isolation
- Birthrates low; pregnancy discouraged due to developmental unknowns
- Rumors of genetic adaptation research

### Communication
- Real-time communication with Earth (minimal delay at geostationary)
- Heavily monitored
- News from below arrives with emotional impact
- Orbital residents develop detachment from terrestrial concerns

## Sensory Details

### Sounds
- The constant hum of life support systems
- Air recyclers, water processors, power conduits
- The absence of natural sound is unnerving
- Music is precious; live performances are rare celebrations

### Smells
- Recycled air has a metallic tang
- Hydroponics sections smell of green growth
- Industrial zones carry chemical traces
- Personal scent becomes noticeable in enclosed spaces

### Tactile
- The strange sensation of reduced gravity
- Handholds everywhere; floating is controlled
- Temperature carefully regulated but never quite right
- The vibration of docking climbers felt through the structure

### Sights
- Curved corridors (the ring's rotation)
- Earth through every exterior port
- Holographic displays in multiple languages
- The mix of corporate sterility and human improvisation
- Plants growing in observation lounges: precious, treasured

## Key Locations for Scenes

1. **The Arrival Dome**: Where climbers dock; first view of Earth from above
2. **The Observation Deck**: Public viewing platform, often crowded, always emotional
3. **The Corporate Spires**: Luxury quarters for executives and investors
4. **The Worker Modules**: Cramped, functional, community-oriented
5. **The Greenhouse Ring**: Agricultural section, oasis of green
6. **The Shipyard Overlook**: Where the next era of exploration is being built
7. **The Mediation Chamber**: Where disputes are settled, sometimes fairly
8. **The Chapel of All Faiths**: Interfaith space, perpetually busy

## Symbolic Weight

The Orbital Hub represents:
- **Humanity's potential**: We reached the stars
- **Humanity's failure**: We brought our divisions with us
- **A new beginning**: Or just a new arena for old conflicts
- **The overview effect**: Seeing Earth whole changes some; others remain unchanged

Arriving at the hub should feel like:
- **Transcendence and disappointment**
- **Beauty and claustrophobia**
- **The future, already compromised**
