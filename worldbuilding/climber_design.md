# Climber Design: The Ascending Vessel

## Overview

The passenger climber is a self-contained vertical city, ascending the Babel Elevator over five to seven days. It is cathedral, prison, crucible, and stage—a pressurized microcosm where humanity's divisions and aspirations are compressed into shared altitude.

## External Structure

### Dimensions
- **Height**: Approximately 200 meters (equivalent to a 60-story building)
- **Width**: 40–50 meters at widest point
- **Mass**: Variable; passenger climbers ~15,000 tonnes fully loaded

### Shape
- Elongated ovoid, tapered at top and bottom
- Designed for aerodynamic efficiency in lower atmosphere
- Becomes irrelevant in vacuum but affects structural loading
- Exterior sheathed in reflective, heat-resistant panels
- Running lights visible from Earth as it ascends

### The Grip Mechanism
- Surrounds the tether in an embrace
- Electromagnetic drive wheels engage the ribbon
- Redundant systems prevent any single point of failure
- The "heartbeat" of the climber: a rhythmic pulse passengers can feel
- Emergency release systems for catastrophic scenarios

## Internal Layout

### Vertical Organization

The climber is organized into **stacked decks**, each with distinct character:

**Lower Decks (1–10): Cargo and Machinery**
- Cargo holds
- Life support systems
- Water and food storage
- Engineering spaces
- Crew quarters for technical staff
- Passenger access restricted

**Middle Decks (11–30): Economy and Standard Class**
- Dense cabin configurations
- Shared common areas
- Lottery winners and workers housed here
- Functional but not luxurious
- The "real" journey happens in these decks

**Upper Decks (31–45): Premium and Luxury**
- Spacious private cabins
- Fine dining, exclusive lounges
- Corporate suites
- VIP passengers, investors, dignitaries
- Shielded from economy passengers (mostly)

**Top Decks (46–50): The Observation Sphere**
- The crown of the climber
- 360-degree transparent dome
- Open to all passengers at scheduled times
- The great equalizer: everyone sees the same view
- Capacity limited; queues form

### Horizontal Layout (Typical Deck)

- Central shaft: the tether passes through the climber's core
- Visible through reinforced transparent panels on some decks
- Structural ring around the core
- Cabins, common areas, and facilities radiate outward
- Outer ring contains viewing ports
- Corridors curve; the sense of enclosure is constant

## Key Spaces

### The Grand Atrium
- Spans multiple decks in the middle section
- A vertical garden with living plants
- Natural light piped via fiber optics (in lower atmosphere)
- Gathering place, social hub
- Symbolic: life reaching upward

### Observation Lounges (Multiple)
- Scattered throughout the vessel
- Some class-restricted, some open
- Floor-to-ceiling ports facing Earth or stars
- Seating arranged for contemplation
- Where passengers go to process what they're experiencing

### The Dining Halls
- Separated by class, with exceptions for special occasions
- On the maiden voyage, some dinners are integrated (tension ensues)
- Menus designed for changing gravity (utensils, food textures)
- Cultural cuisines represented; food is political

### Medical Bay
- Full hospital facilities
- Prepared for altitude sickness, psychological distress, emergencies
- Includes a morgue (discretely located)
- Birth during ascent has not yet occurred—a source of speculation

### The Chapel/Meditation Space
- Interfaith design
- Growing importance as ascent continues
- Some passengers become religious en route
- Others lose their faith
- Always occupied

### The Press Center
- Dedicated space for journalists
- Broadcast facilities for the live feed to Earth
- Controlled access; messaging is managed
- Underground networks for uncensored reporting

### The Security Hub
- Private security forces monitor everything
- Detention facilities exist (passengers don't know where)
- Access to all systems
- Their presence is subtle but omnipresent

## Passenger Experience

### Boarding
- Ceremonial process at the anchor city terminal
- Security screening invasive and thorough
- Class separation begins immediately
- The wealthy board through different gates
- Lottery winners are celebrated, then segregated

### The First Hours
- Atmospheric ascent is slow
- Earth visible in detail: weather, geography, home
- Passengers gather at windows
- Euphoria mixed with anxiety
- The climber shakes slightly passing through turbulence

### Day One to Two
- Blue sky fades to black
- Stars become visible even during local "day"
- Gravity noticeably decreasing
- Passengers adapt (or don't)
- Social mixing begins despite class boundaries

### Mid-Journey
- The long passage
- Routine establishes: meals, observation times, social events
- Tensions surface; small conflicts become meaningful
- The weight of what they're doing settles in
- Some passengers withdraw; others seek connection

### High Altitude
- Near-weightlessness requires adaptation
- Handholds, tethers, floating etiquette
- The overview effect peaks
- Conversations become philosophical, confessional
- Earth is a marble; home is an abstraction

### Arrival
- The orbital hub appears as a glittering ring
- Docking procedures take hours
- Passengers gather for final views
- Disembarkation is emotional, chaotic
- Some don't want to leave the climber; it has become home

## Sensory Details

### Sounds
- The rhythmic pulse of the drive mechanism
- Air circulation: ever-present white noise
- Announcements in multiple languages
- The creak and settle of the structure under changing loads
- In high altitude: uncanny silence

### Smells
- Recycled air with faint chemical undertones
- Food smells concentrated in enclosed spaces
- The green scent of the atrium plants
- Personal scents become noticeable
- Some passengers overuse perfumes; others don't wash

### Touch
- The constant slight vibration of ascent
- Decreasing weight as altitude increases
- The smooth, clinical surfaces
- Handholds become second nature
- The sensation of floating (high altitude)

### Light
- Artificial lighting cycles mimicking Earth normal
- Natural light through observation ports shifts dramatically
- The blue of Earth, the black of space, the unfiltered sun
- Darkness during Earth's shadow

## Safety and Control

### Emergency Protocols
- Pressure loss: compartmentalization, emergency suits
- Drive failure: secondary systems, controlled descent
- Medical emergency: hospital facilities, emergency descent possible
- Fire: suppression systems, evacuation routes
- "Unrest": security response protocols (vaguely defined)

### Passenger Surveillance
- Cameras everywhere except private cabins
- Communications monitored
- Movement tracked via embedded ID chips
- "For safety"—but also for control
- Some passengers find ways around it

### Class Boundaries
- Physical barriers between sections
- Access controlled by ID chips
- Boundaries theoretically permeable for "events"
- In practice: firm, resented, occasionally breached
- The maiden voyage promises more integration (reality differs)

## The Maiden Voyage Specifics

For the story's central journey:

### Passenger Manifest
- **200 VIPs**: investors, politicians, celebrities
- **150 workers**: engineers, crew, maintenance (but few construction workers)
- **100 lottery winners**: from global draw
- **50 journalists**: carefully selected
- **Unspecified others**: students, activists (some with hidden agendas)

### Special Features
- Historic occasion programming
- Mixed-class events to showcase "unity"
- Live global broadcast
- Heightened security
- Heightened everything

## Symbolic Weight

The climber represents:
- **A cross-section of humanity**: forced together
- **Hierarchy made architectural**: the wealthy literally above
- **The journey as transformation**: passengers arrive changed
- **A vessel of hope**: or of division ascending
- **The capsule of the human condition**: sealed, pressurized, ascending
