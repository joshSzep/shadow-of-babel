# Chapter 1: What Was Here

The tether was the first thing she saw each morning. It had been the first thing for thirty-eight years.

Teiti opened her eyes to the glow of it through the window—a blade of light cutting the dark sky, rising from somewhere she could no longer name and ascending into a heaven she had never believed in. Running lights traced its length in slow pulses, red and white, patient as heartbeats. The tower that had swallowed her world, visible from every window of every room she had occupied since the waters changed.

She lay still for a moment, watching. The apartment was small: a bed, a chair, a table, a hotplate. The walls were thin enough to hear her neighbor's morning prayers, thin enough to feel the constant low vibration that thrummed through every structure in the city. That hum came from the tether's base, from the anchor that gripped the earth—or what had been earth, what had been seafloor, what had been reef.

Today she would ascend it.

The thought arrived without ceremony. She had known for three months, since the Builders' Union negotiated her passage among the fifty seats they had wrested from the Consortium. She had refused twice before. The third time, Kofi Mensah had asked her directly: *Who else can carry what you carry?*

She had no answer. So she agreed.

---

Teiti rose slowly, her knees announcing themselves as they did every morning—the right one grinding, the left one sharp. Seventy-one years of equatorial sun and salt water and concrete floors. She had been young once, in a place that no longer existed, and her body remembered it better than her mind allowed.

The window faced east, toward the tether. She stood before it and let her eyes trace the line upward until it vanished into the pre-dawn black. Somewhere beyond sight, it continued—36,000 kilometers, they said, though the number meant nothing to her. What mattered was simpler: it went up, and up, and up, and it never came down. It hung from the sky like a thread lowered by gods who had forgotten to pull it back.

Below the tether's glow, the city spread in rings of light. The inner rings blazed—the Ascension District, the terminals, the hotels where people who would ride today had slept in climate-controlled air. The outer rings guttered, dimmer, interrupted. The Workers' Quarter, where she stood. The sprawl beyond, where the ones who would never ride huddled in structures that had been temporary for twenty years.

Te Rarawa. The Arrival.

That was the name they had given this place, in her language, as if naming it in Gilbertese made it belong to her people. As if the word could paper over what lay beneath.

She called it by its other name, the one the elders used when no officials were listening.

*Te Mate.* The Death.

---

She dressed in the dark, her hands finding the familiar textures. The *te kie*—the woven pandanus mat—she wrapped around her waist and over one shoulder, the way her mother had taught her, the way her grandmother had worn it on Tarawa before Tarawa began to drown. The weaving was tight and even, made by her own hands in the long evenings when sleep would not come. She had made one for Teriki once, for their wedding, and he had worn it for thirty years until the sea took him back.

She tucked a white frangipani behind her ear. The flower was synthetic—real ones did not grow well in the city's filtered air—but the gesture was true. Her grandfather had told her that the flower was for travelers, for those crossing water or leaving home. He had not imagined a journey like this one.

From beneath her pillow, she retrieved the photograph.

Teriki looked up at her from forty years ago, his face caught in a moment before everything. He wore his work coveralls, the ones he had put on that last morning, and his smile was the one she had fallen in love with on Abaiang, when they were both young and the ocean was still full of fish. The photograph was laminated now, its edges soft from handling, and she had carried it through every day of the twenty years since his death.

She pressed it to her lips, briefly. Then she slid it into the small bag she would carry, alongside the things that mattered: a bottle of water, her identification papers, a smooth stone from a beach that no longer existed.

The corridor outside her apartment was already stirring. Voices in three languages, footsteps, the clatter of doors. Her neighbors were workers—maintenance crews, dock hands, cleaners—and their shifts did not wait for the sun. A young Vietnamese woman nodded to her as she passed, her eyes flicking to Teiti's traditional clothing, then away. The young ones did not always know what to make of her. The old ones did.

"*Mauri*, Mama Teiti," said a voice from behind her.

She turned. Ibrahim, the Senegalese engineer who lived two doors down, was leaning against his doorframe with a cup of tea. His hair was graying at the temples now, though he had been young when she first met him, young and full of conviction that the Union could change things.

"*Mauri*, Ibrahim."

"Today is the day." It was not a question.

"It is."

He looked at her for a long moment, his expression unreadable. "You'll speak for us?"

"I'll speak for the dead." She said it simply, without weight. "That's all I can promise."

He nodded slowly. "That's enough." He raised his cup to her—a toast, a blessing, she was not sure. "Safe journey, Mama. Come back to us."

She did not answer. She was not sure she would.

---

The Workers' Quarter woke in layers. First the shift workers, heading to the docks and the maintenance tunnels. Then the vendors, setting up their carts in the narrow streets, filling the air with the smell of fried dough and recycled coffee. Then the children, running to the community schools that the Union had fought for, their voices high and sharp in the humid air.

Teiti walked through it all, her pace unhurried. She had walked these streets for thirty-eight years—since the platform was just a platform, since the tether was just a plan, since her people still believed the promises that had been made. She knew the cracks in the pavement, the walls where the workers had painted murals of the dead, the corner where the Consortium's security cameras had a blind spot and the organizers sometimes gathered.

The city had grown around her like coral around a shipwreck. But coral was dead now. She had watched them kill it.

She passed the market where women sold fish that had been frozen somewhere far away, because no fish lived in these waters anymore. She passed the clinic where Tebuke had been diagnosed, where the doctor had looked at the scan and then looked away. She passed the *maneaba*—the meeting house the I-Kiribati community had rebuilt three times, because the officials kept finding reasons to tear it down—where she had stood before a hundred workers and taught them how to fight.

All of it was built on a grave.

The Phoenix Islands had been the most pristine marine ecosystem on Earth. Teiti had visited them once as a girl, sailing with her grandfather for two days across open water to reach the reefs that the elders said were sacred. She remembered the moment she first put her face beneath the surface: the shock of clarity, water so transparent it seemed like air, and below her a world of color and motion that her young mind could not contain.

"The fish are so thick you can walk on their backs," her grandfather had told her, and she had not believed him, and then she had seen it with her own eyes. Silver clouds of trevally and tuna. Manta rays gliding like dark angels. Coral in colors she had no words for, some of it older than the pyramids, growing centimeter by centimeter across millennia.

The Consortium had needed that reef destroyed.

She understood the engineering, abstractly. The tether required an anchor point at the equator, in deep water, far from population centers. The Phoenix Islands were perfect: isolated, nearly uninhabited, politically vulnerable. Kiribati had been desperate—the home islands were drowning, the money was unimaginable, the promises were sweet.

The Phoenix Compact was signed when she was thirty-three years old. By the time she was forty, the reef was rubble.

She had watched the dredging ships arrive. She had watched the concrete pour into water that had been clear for ten thousand years. She had watched the fish die—not dramatically, not all at once, but in the slow suffocation of a world being smothered. The manta rays left first, then the turtles, then the sharks. The coral bleached, died, was scraped away. The seabed that her grandfather had navigated by memory was reshaped into a foundation for humanity's longest ladder.

And Teriki had helped build it. That was the wound she could not close.

The Shadow Memorial stood at the edge of the Workers' Quarter, where the neighborhood gave way to the service roads that fed the Ascension District. It was not an official site—the Consortium's Memorial Wall was in the Grand Terminal, carved in marble, listing the 847 who had died on Black Day. The Shadow Memorial was different. It was theirs.

The wall was concrete, five meters wide and three meters tall, built by workers on their own time, with materials salvaged from construction sites. The names were etched by hand, some in neat rows, some crowded into corners, some added so recently the concrete dust still clung to the letters. 1,247 names. Every worker who had died building the elevator—not just Black Day, but all of them. The anchor collapse. The climber failures. The falls, the decompressions, the radiation. The disappeared.

Teiti stood before it in the gray light and let her eyes find the name she always found first.

TERIKI NAKIBAE
2011–2065
Anchor Collapse
He built what he could not climb

She had written those words herself, carving them into wet concrete on the first anniversary of his death, her hands shaking, her eyes dry because she had already wept for a year and had no tears left. The other families had found her there in the morning, still working, still carving, and one by one they had joined her. By sunset, the wall held 23 names. By the next year, hundreds. Now it held them all.

She reached out and touched the letters of his name. The concrete was cool in the morning air, worn smooth by years of hands doing exactly what she was doing now.

"I'm going up today," she said quietly. The language was Gilbertese, the words meant only for him. "I refused for twenty years. But they asked me to speak for the dead, and I couldn't find a reason to say no."

The tether glowed behind her, its running lights still pulsing in the darkness.

"They built it on your grave, Teriki. On the reef where your father taught you to dive. On the waters where my grandfather fished. I will ascend the thing that killed you, and I will look down at where you lie, and I do not know what I will feel."

She was silent for a moment. A transport droned overhead, heading for the terminal.

"I will speak your name in the place they denied you. That much I can promise."

She pressed her palm flat against the wall, feeling the names against her skin—not just Teriki's, but all of them. The 23 of the anchor collapse. The 12 from Climber 17. The 847 of Black Day. The construction dead, the radiation dead, the disappeared. Her son Tebuke was on this wall too, added three years ago, dead of a cancer that the Consortium called unrelated.

"I'll speak for all of you," she said. "In their tower. In their triumph. I'll make them hear."

The sun was rising now, painting the eastern sky in shades of orange and gold. The tether caught the light and blazed, a line of fire connecting earth to heaven. Teiti watched it transform, the running lights fading as the sun took over, the structure revealing itself in its true scale for the first time that morning.

It was beautiful. She had never denied that.

The first time she had seen it completed, she had wept—not for grief, but for awe. The thing itself was a miracle, a thread spun from carbon and ambition, humanity's longest reach toward the stars. She had helped build it. Her hands had placed components in the anchor platform. Her husband had assembled structures at altitudes where the sky turned black. They had been part of something unprecedented, and for a few years, before the betrayals accumulated, she had believed it meant something good.

She still believed it meant something. Just not what they wanted it to mean.

The Consortium saw triumph. The passengers saw adventure. The investors saw profit. Teiti saw a ladder built on corpses, rising from a graveyard of coral and bone. Both were true. That was what made it unbearable.

Awe with a shadow. That was the phrase she had used once, in a speech to the Union, trying to explain why she had not bombed the tether, why she had not joined the radicals who wanted it torn down. You could not deny the miracle. You could only insist that the cost be named.

She turned from the memorial and began walking toward the terminal. Behind her, the names of the dead waited in their wall of concrete. Ahead, the tether waited in its wall of light. She carried Teriki's photograph in her bag, and she carried the reef in her memory, and she carried the weight of every promise that had been broken.

Today she would ascend the tower built on her husband's grave, on her homeland's grave.

She would carry all of it with her.

The Workers' Channel was a separate entrance, away from the gleaming facades of the public terminal and the private suites of the VIP gates. It was a loading dock, essentially—a place where cargo and workers entered without disturbing the aesthetics of departure. The Consortium had offered her the VIP treatment: a handler, a private lounge, boarding with the dignitaries. She had refused.

"I've walked with the workers for forty years," she told the liaison who called. "I'll board with them now."

The queue was already forming when she arrived. Fifty workers, selected through a process she did not entirely trust—the Union had negotiated the seats, but the Consortium had final approval, and the faces she saw were not all the faces she would have chosen. Too many of the firebrands had been quietly excluded. Too many of the compliant had been quietly included. But they were workers, all of them, people whose hands or whose parents' hands had built what they were about to climb.

She took her place at the end of the line. No one offered to let her move forward, and she was grateful for that. Mama Teiti was a title of respect, but it did not come with privileges she had not earned.

"Mama." A voice behind her. Low, rough, familiar.

She turned. Yusuf Haddad stood a few meters back, his ticket visible in his hand, his face carrying the same weight she saw in her own mirror. He was younger than her by twenty-three years, but the work had aged him—the gray in his beard, the missing fingers on his left hand, the way he held himself as if bracing for a blow that had already landed.

"Yusuf." She nodded, the greeting of equals. "I didn't know you had passage."

"Neither did I, until three months ago." His voice was carefully neutral. "Someone sent me a ticket. No note."

She understood without asking. There were things in this city that did not need to be said aloud.

"And you came anyway."

"I built this thing." He looked up at the tether, his expression unreadable. "I figured I should see where it goes."

She almost smiled. Almost. "That's why I'm here too."

They stood in silence as the line shuffled forward, as the security checks began, as the morning light grew stronger and the tether blazed against the sky. Around them, workers murmured in half a dozen languages, nervousness and excitement and old anger mixing in the humid air.

"They'll want you to bless it," Yusuf said quietly. "The Consortium. That's why they let you on. An elder of the Builders' Union, ascending in triumph, proof that the workers have forgiven."

"I know."

"Will you?"

Teiti was silent for a long moment. The queue moved forward. The terminal loomed ahead, a cathedral of glass and steel, its doors opening onto a journey she had refused for two decades.

"I'll speak the truth," she said finally. "In their tower, in their ceremony, I'll tell them what was here before. What was destroyed. What was taken." She touched the bag at her side, where Teriki's photograph waited. "I don't know if that's a blessing or a curse. But it's what I have."

Yusuf nodded slowly. His eyes were on the tether, on the impossible line of light rising into the morning sky.

"Then I'll listen," he said. "That's what I have."

The doors opened. The workers moved forward. Teiti stepped across the threshold into the terminal, the hum of the tether's anchor vibrating through the floor beneath her feet, the weight of 1,247 names pressing against her heart.

The tower rose before her, bright and terrible.

She began to climb.
