# Chapter 6: The Press Room

The security line for press was shorter than the public queue, but no less invasive.

Amara stood with credentials displayed, equipment bag open, her face arranged in the patient neutrality she'd learned in checkpoints from Bamako to Brussels. The scanner hummed over her, lingering at the recording devices—three of them, because redundancy was survival—and the officer's eyes moved between her face and the biometric readout with the particular attention reserved for those whose job was to observe.

"Purpose of travel?"

"Embedded correspondent. Global News Alliance."

"Equipment manifest?"

She handed over the tablet. Everything declared, approved, subject to review.

"You're cleared. Press staging, east corridor."

She gathered her bags. Twenty-three years had taught her to read checkpoints like text—what they asked, what they revealed about who was welcome and who was tolerated. This one said: *We let you in because we have to.*

She would watch them back.

---

The press staging area occupied a glass-walled corner of the terminal's second level, overlooking the main concourse. Amara paused at the entrance—familiar faces, unfamiliar tension, colleagues who were also competitors about to be sealed together for a week.

"Amara." Michael Chen rose from a workstation near the window. Silver hair, New York Times, thirty years on the space beat. "I was wondering when you'd show."

"Equipment check. My backup recorder looked suspicious."

"Everything looks suspicious to them. Half of us got secondary screening."

Heinrich Müller was visible across the space, Der Spiegel, deep in conversation with someone from BBC Science. Perhaps fifteen journalists already, with more arriving—a geography of outlets that would shape how the world understood this voyage.

She spotted Fatou Sow near the refreshment table, the young Africa24 correspondent looking overwhelmed and determined in equal measure. First major international assignment. Amara remembered that vertigo.

"The press room aboard is Deck 12," Michael said. "Thirty square meters. They called it generous."

"It always is."

She claimed an unclaimed workstation, eyes scanning. Priya Krishnamurthy from The Hindu, notebook out. Ricardo Gonzalez from Clarín, reviewing footage. Through the glass, the terminal concourse spread below—passengers flowing toward gates, separated by architecture into streams that rarely touched.

The VIP channel barely visible, discrete, frictionless. Lottery queues stretching in patient lines. And beyond it all, through the soaring windows, the climber—200 meters of silver-white, running lights pulsing against morning sky.

"First time seeing it in person?" Michael asked.

"I covered the construction. Came here six times." She didn't look away. "But the finished thing is different."

"It always is."

---

"Ms. Diallo?" A young woman in Consortium livery, tablet in hand, smile calibrated. "Daniela Reyes. Your media liaison."

"I remember. You said you'd have my interview schedule by boarding."

"I have a preliminary framework. There have been adjustments."

*Adjustments.* Certain interviews no longer convenient. Certain questions anticipated, the landscape rearranged.

The briefing room was smaller, windowless. Daniela handed her a tablet: itinerary, access schedule, "messaging guidelines."

Director Nakamura: thirty minutes on Day 2, "background only." Chairman Murakami: "TBD pending schedule confirmation"—available if coverage pleased him.

The worker delegation appeared once: *Worker representatives available for human interest features. Contact liaison for coordination.*

Human interest features. She'd spent two years investigating the labor conditions that built this elevator. Workers in hospital rooms. Memorial gatherings where families spoke names the Consortium preferred to forget. 1,247 dead by the Shadow Memorial's count.

Now they were features. Available for coordination.

Her phone buzzed. Her editor: *File color from boarding—view, mood, human angle. Save the hard stuff for later.*

*Understood. Tell Aïssatou I'll call before departure.*

---

The press briefing was efficient and carefully uninformative.

Yusuke Tanaka, Consortium communications, walked them through timelines and protocols. Bandwidth limited, priority-allocated. Pool footage distributed through official channels.

Heinrich asked about engineering access: restricted, though a tour could be arranged. Priya asked about the I-Kiribati delegation: available through proper channels. Michael asked about Chairman Murakami: schedule still being finalized.

Amara asked about the worker compensation passengers—thirty people whose tickets represented decades-old promises finally, partially fulfilled.

Tanaka's expression flickered.

"The worker honorees are a wonderful part of this voyage's story. Many helped build the very structure they're now ascending. We're proud to have them aboard."

*Their contributions.* Not their losses. Not the colleagues they'd buried.

"I'd like to speak with Teiti Nakibae specifically. The Builders' Union elder."

The flicker again, longer. "Mrs. Nakibae is a significant figure. I'll check with her handlers."

"Her handlers?"

"The delegation coordinators. I'll be in touch."

The briefing moved on. Amara wrote *T.N.—resistance* in her notebook, in shorthand no device could read.

---

The press boarding channel ran parallel to the passenger flows, separated by one-way glass—journalists could see out, passengers could not see in.

Amara paused where three streams converged.

The VIP channel on the far right: passengers gliding through minimal checkpoints, friction designed away. Henrik Lindqvist, whom she'd questioned at the press conference, moving with the confidence of someone who belonged everywhere. Ambassador Sharma in silk. Lin Xiaoming surrounded by assistants.

The standard queue in the center: lottery winners, scholarship recipients, families with children pointing at the tether. Slower processing, documentation questions, security holds. But moving.

And on the far left, almost hidden by an architectural angle: the workers' channel.

Amara stopped.

Fifty people, maybe. Practical clothes, working-class neat—the dignity of people dressing for an occasion they'd been denied for decades. Some young, but many older, their bodies carrying visible history: weathered hands, careful postures, years of labor.

They processed through their own checkpoints with the patience of those accustomed to being processed.

Then she saw her.

An elderly woman near the front. Small but commanding. Traditional woven fabric against the terminal's sleek surfaces. White hair. A flower behind one ear—synthetic, probably, but deliberate. She stood still while others moved around her, a point of stillness in the flow.

A handler approached. Consortium livery, tablet, professional body language. Amara couldn't hear the exchange, but she could read it: the handler gesturing toward another direction—VIP, probably; the elderly woman shaking her head, once; the handler trying again; the woman not moving.

The handler consulted her tablet. Spoke into an earpiece. Waited.

The elderly woman waited too. Patient. Immovable. Her expression carrying quiet authority that made the handler's confidence seem suddenly thin.

The handler stepped aside.

The elderly woman continued into the workers' channel. Something in her shoulders suggested this wasn't new—that she had spent decades refusing to be moved.

*Teiti Nakibae.* The Builders' Union elder. The widow of the anchor collapse. The woman who had organized the first memorial, who had forced the Consortium to acknowledge the dead.

Boarding with the workers because she was a worker.

Amara opened her notebook: *T.N. refused VIP redirect. Traditional dress. Handler failed. Watch her.*

A hand at her elbow. Daniela.

"Ms. Diallo? Press boarding is this way."

"Of course." She closed the notebook. "Just observing."

"The official footage will have better angles."

"I'm sure."

She let herself be guided away, but looked back once—through the glass, where the elderly woman was presenting her credentials with the same patient dignity she'd shown in refusing the escort.

*I'll find you. And I'll try to tell it true.*

---

The climber's press room was exactly as Michael had described: thirty square meters of managed efficiency, workstations and broadcast equipment crammed between the Business Class lounge and a service corridor.

Amara claimed a station near the wall—positioned to see the entrance without being immediately visible.

"Cozy," Heinrich said, settling beside her. "I've covered NATO summits with more space."

"At least NATO summits let you leave."

"True." He began unpacking equipment. "I saw you watching the workers' channel."

"Observing the passenger mix."

"Mm." He didn't look up. "I've been covering the elevator since '71. The workers were promised passage—not *some* workers, all workers. That was the recruitment pitch."

"I know."

"Some of those people have been waiting forty years. And now they board through a side entrance while executives glide through VIP."

"It's a story."

"It's *the* story. Whether we're allowed to tell it—different question."

The press room's main screen flickered: departure plaza, the climber gleaming. A countdown clock: *DEPARTURE: 3:47:22*.

Less than four hours.

Amara began her first dispatch: boarding color, atmosphere, the human angle. Cathedral scale, passenger diversity, historic occasion. She did not mention the workers' channel, or the elderly woman who had refused redirection.

Not yet. That story needed the interview she would pursue, the threads she would follow.

She filed what could be filed, and held close what needed to be held.

---

Her phone buzzed: video call from Paris. Aïssatou's face on the caller ID.

She stepped into the corridor.

"Mama! I saw you! On the news! Papa showed me—you were in the background!"

"You spotted me?"

"Papa had to point you out. But then I saw you! You looked very serious."

"I was working."

"You always look serious when you're working." Aïssatou's expression shifted. "Are you on the elevator yet?"

"I'm inside the climber. But there aren't any windows in the press room—just walls."

"That's boring."

"It is. But I'll send you pictures when we start moving. Pictures of Earth getting smaller."

"Promise?"

"Promise."

In the background, Mathieu's voice. Her co-parent, good with their daughter in ways Amara couldn't always be, present in the daily accumulation that Amara experienced mostly through screens.

"Your grandmother called," Aïssatou said, quieter. "She said to tell you she's proud of you. Even when you're far away."

The words landed. Her mother in Dakar, dying slowly, still following her daughter's career as if tracking a ship toward some horizon she wouldn't live to see.

"Tell her I'll call tomorrow. From space."

"She said space is too far. She said you should come home instead."

"I know." The familiar guilt. "I'll come home soon. After this."

"That's what you always say."

"I know." She stopped. What could she promise? The voyage was a week. Then there would be another story, another reason to be somewhere that wasn't home.

"I'll try," she said. "I'll really try."

Aïssatou studied her with the disconcerting perception of children who have learned to read their parents' absences. Then she nodded.

"Okay. Send me the pictures."

"I will."

"I love you, Mama."

"I love you too, *ma petite*. More than the stars."

The call ended. Amara stood in the corridor, phone still warm.

Somewhere in this vessel, five hundred passengers were settling. Some had paid fortunes. Some had won lotteries. Some had built what they were about to climb.

And one elderly I-Kiribati woman was somewhere in economy, probably in a dormitory cabin, carrying the names of the dead in whatever ceremony she planned for the altitude where no one could stop her.

*That's the story. Not the achievement—the cost. Not who's ascending, but who was left below.*

She walked back to the press room.

---

The first tremor came at 14:00, exactly on schedule.

Amara felt it through the floor—a vibration that was more presence than motion, the electromagnetic drive engaging with the tether.

Around her, journalists paused. Heinrich and Michael continued working, having covered enough launches to know the tremor was normal.

The vibration deepened. She felt it in her bones now, patient and enormous. The climber was lifting—not fast, not dramatically, but with the certainty of a tide.

She began to type:

*The climber lifts. Not with rocket drama, but with patient inevitability. The floor vibrates—a heartbeat, some call it, though hearts are rarely this steady.*

*Below, Te Rarawa shrinks. Terminal dome, towers, rings of city spreading to sea. Somewhere down there, people watch us rise—people who built this miracle and were denied passage, who entered lotteries and lost, who will spend their lives looking up.*

*Five hundred passengers and seventy-five crew. Some paid fortunes. Some won through luck. Some built it with their hands and are only now, decades later, permitted to ride what they made.*

*The official story is triumph. The real story is something else.*

She stopped. These words were for her notebook—observations she would hold until she understood what they meant.

Through the press room's single window: sky transitioning from equatorial blue to something deeper.

Five days to orbit. Five days to find the story beneath the story.

Amara saved her notes, encrypted them, and began planning her approach to the workers' deck.

Teiti Nakibae was waiting, somewhere below in the climber's hierarchy.

The floor hummed, carrying them all toward whatever they would find above the sky.
