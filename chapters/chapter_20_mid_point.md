# Chapter 20: Mid-Point

## I.

The gravity was wrong.

Zara noticed it before she was fully awake. A lightness in her limbs, a strange buoyancy that made the simple act of lying in her bunk feel like floating on water. She had been dreaming of something she couldn't quite remember, and the transition to consciousness felt like surfacing from a deep pool, rising through layers of pressure toward light.

She opened her eyes. The cabin's artificial dawn had begun its slow brightening, mimicking a sunrise that was happening nowhere. Through the narrow porthole beside her bunk, she could see stars. Steady, unblinking, impossibly numerous. And below them, distant now, the curve of Earth.

Day three. They had been rising for fifty-six hours. The altitude readout on her tablet, which drifted slightly before her fingers caught it, said 14,200 kilometers.

*Fourteen thousand kilometers.* She let the number settle into her physicist's understanding of what it meant. The gravity here was something she couldn't name. Lighter. Wrong. Not weightlessness. That came later, or something close to it, when the numbers stopped matching what her body expected. Her instruments could give her a number. Her muscles already had. Everything she had learned about mechanics, about force and mass and acceleration, was being rewritten as she swung her legs over the edge of her bunk and felt herself rise too fast, too far.

Tomoko was already awake, floating half-upright in her own bunk with a tablet propped against her knees.

"The station," Tomoko said without looking up. "It's visible now."

---

The mid-point station hung in the viewport like a jewel suspended in black velvet, above them still.

Zara had found her way to the Level 12 observation alcove, the quiet one near the maintenance corridor, the place she and Tomoko had claimed as their own. The other scholarship students were gathering in the main observation dome for the official viewing, complete with commentary from the PR handlers and commemorative photographs. She had slipped away after breakfast, wanting to see this alone.

The station was smaller than she had expected. A rotating ring perhaps two kilometers in diameter, connected to the tether by a framework of struts that looked impossibly delicate at this scale. As it turned, a thin line of shadow swept across its surface like a seam catching and releasing light. Through the enhanced viewport, she could see lights moving along its edge: maintenance drones, or perhaps shuttles ferrying crew between sections.

*The first station built,* she remembered from the briefing materials. *Completed in 2073. The critical maintenance hub.*

But the materials hadn't mentioned what it felt like to see it. This lonely outpost hanging halfway between Earth and orbit, staffed by skeleton crews who lived months at a time in a gravity well that belonged to neither world. She thought about the workers there, watching the maiden voyage climber approach and pass. Did they press their faces to viewports, the way passengers did? Or had the view become routine, the way all miracles became routine when you lived inside them long enough?

A sound behind her. Footsteps, though "steps" was too strong a word for the careful, bouncing gait that reduced gravity required.

Zara turned and found herself facing Dr. Miriam Okonkwo.

---

The architect looked different than she had at the corporate reception. Smaller somehow, though that made no sense. She wore simple clothes rather than the formal attire of official functions, and her graying hair was wrapped in a practical style that suggested she had dressed for observation rather than appearances. Her reading glasses hung from a cord around her neck.

"I'm sorry," Miriam said. "I didn't realize anyone else had found this spot."

"It's fine." Zara moved aside, making room at the viewport. "There's space."

For a moment they stood in silence, watching the station grow incrementally larger as the climber continued its ascent. The tether stretched above and below them, a thread of darkness against the stars—visible now only by the running lights that marked its length, by the occasional flash of a maintenance drone traversing its surface.

"You're one of the scholarship students," Miriam said finally. "I saw you at the reception."

"Zara Chen-Okafor." She wasn't sure whether to offer her hand—the gesture felt strange in reduced gravity, where every movement required recalibration. "Imperial College. Physics."

"I know." Miriam's voice was neutral, but something flickered in her expression. Recognition, perhaps, or something more complicated. "Your algorithm. The oscillation dampening refinement. I read the paper."

Zara felt heat rise to her face. She had written that paper in her second year of graduate studies, working from Dr. Okonkwo's foundational research—the mathematical framework that had made the elevator possible in the first place. Having the architect herself reference it felt like standing in front of a mirror and seeing someone else's reflection.

"It was just a refinement," she said. "The core solution was yours."

"The core solution was mathematics. Your refinement made it work in practice." Miriam turned back to the viewport, and her voice softened. "That's the harder part, usually. Making things work in practice."

The station was closer now—close enough that Zara could see individual modules, the segmented sections of the rotating ring, the docking ports where shuttles came and went. In another hour, they would pass within a few hundred meters. Close enough to see faces in the windows, if anyone was watching.

"Does it stop?" Zara asked. "The climber, I mean. At the station."

"Not this voyage. The maiden voyage is direct. Earth to hub. No transfers." Miriam's hand moved to the viewport frame, steadying herself against the gentle sway of the climber's motion. "Normally, yes. Passengers can transfer here—continue to the hub, or take a shuttle back to Earth. It's the last easy point of return."

*The last easy point of return.* The phrase settled into Zara's chest with unexpected weight.

"After this," she said slowly, "the energy required to descend equals the energy required to continue."

"Roughly. The math is more complicated—you'd have to account for the changing gravitational gradient, the tether's tension profile, the—" Miriam stopped herself, and something that might have been a smile crossed her face. "But yes. The basic principle. After the mid-point, you're committed. It's as hard to go back as to go forward."

Zara watched the station turn slowly in its eternal rotation, catching sunlight on its solar arrays, casting shadows across its own surface.

"How did you know?" she asked. "When you were designing it. How did you know it would work?"

"I didn't." Miriam's voice was quiet, almost confessional. "Not truly. The mathematics said it should work. The simulations said it should work. But mathematics and simulations can't account for everything. There were variables we couldn't model. Factors we didn't anticipate." She paused. "We built it anyway. And then we spent twenty years learning what we'd gotten wrong."

"But it works."

"It works." The words carried something Zara couldn't quite identify—pride, perhaps, or grief, or some compound emotion that combined both. "That's the thing about engineering at this scale. Success doesn't mean you got everything right. It means you got enough right, and the mistakes didn't kill enough people to stop you."

Zara thought of the memorial wall at Te Rarawa—the names she had seen only in photographs, carved into carbon fiber in the shadow of the tether's base. 847 names on the official wall. More, according to the woman who had interrupted their educational briefing. More than twice as many, if you counted everyone.

"Is that why you left?" The question came out before she could stop it. "The Consortium, I mean. Why you retired."

Miriam was silent for a long moment. The station continued its slow passage, and the climber continued its rise, and the stars wheeled imperceptibly around them in patterns Zara knew by heart but had never seen so clearly.

"I left," Miriam said finally, "because I couldn't reconcile what I had built with what it had become. Or perhaps what it had always been, and I had refused to see." She turned to look at Zara directly, and her eyes were dark and measuring.

A maintenance drone crossed the viewport, briefly occluding the station. Miriam tracked it with an engineer's reflex, eyes following the path before returning to Zara.

"They'll use you, you know. The way they—" She stopped, shook her head. "No. That's too clean. It's not that simple. They won't feel like they're using you. They'll feel like they're *helping* you. Investing in you. And you'll feel grateful, and you'll be right to feel grateful, because the access is real, the opportunities are real." Her voice roughened. "That's the ugly part. It's not a conspiracy. It's just a system that needs people like you to prove it's fair, so it gives you exactly enough to make the story true. For you. Only for you."

"I know." Zara's voice was steadier than she expected. "Teiti Nakibae told me. The question isn't whether they use you. The question is what you use them for."

Something shifted in Miriam's expression—surprise, perhaps, or recognition. "You've spoken with Mama Teiti?"

"Briefly. At the observation deck, on the first day." Zara hesitated, then continued. "She watched me being photographed with the other scholarship students. After, she came over. She didn't say much. Just—that. And then she walked away."

"She would." Miriam's voice was soft. "She sees clearly, Teiti. More clearly than most of us can bear."

The station was nearly abreast of them now, rotating serenely in its calculated orbit. Through the viewport, Zara could see a shuttle departing from one of the docking ports—a tiny craft, barely larger than a car, carrying perhaps a dozen people toward some other destination she couldn't guess.

"The scholarship program," she said. "The Stellar Foundation. They want me to be grateful. To prove that the system works." She turned to face Miriam. "And I am grateful, in a way. I'm here. I'm seeing things no one in my family has ever seen. My algorithm is in the systems of this climber. That means something."

"But?"

"But it doesn't mean what they want it to mean. It doesn't prove that anyone could be here, that merit is enough, that the lottery is fair." Zara's voice hardened. "My parents work sixteen-hour days running a restaurant in Hackney. They're smarter than half the executives on the Premium Deck. They'll never see this view."

"No," Miriam said. "They won't."

"So what do I do with that? How do I—" She stopped, frustrated by her own incoherence. "I don't want to be decoration. But I also don't want to throw away what I've been given. There has to be a way to be here and still be honest about why most people can't be."

Miriam was quiet for a long moment. The station was beginning to fall behind them now, shrinking slowly in the viewport as the climber continued its inexorable ascent. In another hour, it would be a point of light again. In another day, it would be invisible, lost in the darkness between Earth and the hub.

"When I was your age," Miriam said finally, "I believed that excellence could change systems. That if I built something undeniably good, something that expanded what humanity could do, the goodness would somehow spread. The achievement would redeem the method." She shook her head slightly. "I was wrong. Or—I don't know. Maybe I was right in a way I couldn't use. Maybe if I'd stayed, fought differently—" She broke off. "No. That's vanity. The system didn't need me to stay. It needed me to build and then be quiet, and when I couldn't be quiet anymore, it needed me to leave. Either way, it continued unchanged."

"So you think I should refuse? Reject the scholarship, go back to—"

"No." The word was sharp, immediate. "I'm not telling you to martyr yourself. That's a different kind of vanity." Miriam turned away from the viewport. "I'm saying—" She paused, and Zara could see her reaching for something, discarding it, trying again. "Take what they offer. Learn. See. But keep something back. Something they don't get to narrate." A bitter half-smile. "I don't know if that's wisdom or just what I wish I'd done. It might be the same thing."

Zara absorbed this. Through the viewport, the station was receding. It felt like stillness here, where there was nothing to measure movement against.

"How do I do that?" she asked. "Practically, I mean. They control the narrative. They have the platforms, the audiences, the—"

"I don't have a formula." Miriam's voice was tired now, the polish stripped away. "But there are people aboard who see clearly. Teiti Nakibae—you've met her. The journalist, Diallo, she's not entirely captured. Some of the workers." She hesitated. "Listen to them. Not to what they want you to do—that's their fight, not yours—but to what they remember. What they lost. That's the part the Consortium can't script."

"Did you listen?" Zara asked. "When you were building it. Were there people telling you what it would cost?"

Miriam's hand tightened on the viewport frame. For a moment she said nothing.

"Yes," she said finally. "There were."

She didn't say what she had done with what she heard. She didn't have to.

The climber hummed around them, carrying them upward through the void. The stars burned cold and eternal. And somewhere below, Earth turned in its ancient rhythm, blue and white and small, growing smaller with every passing hour.

"We're past the mid-point now," Zara said quietly. "Aren't we."

It wasn't a question about geography.

## II.

The observation deck was crowded for the mid-point crossing.

Yusuf had avoided the official viewing—too many cameras, too many speeches, too much performance of wonder he didn't feel. But the workers' alcove on Level 16 had its own viewport, smaller but unmonitored, and Carlos had spread the word that the station would be visible at 0930 ship time.

He stood at the back of the gathering, letting the other workers press forward. They deserved this more than he did, some of them—lottery winners who had never expected to rise, compensation passengers whose settlements had included this single ascent, young crew members for whom the mid-point was just another milestone in an endless series of shifts. They gasped and pointed and called out observations in half a dozen languages, and Yusuf watched them watching, and felt something complicated turn in his chest.

The station hung in the viewport like an accusation.

He had worked there. Not on the station itself. That had been constructed by specialized crews, orbital engineers who rarely descended to Earth. But on the tether sections nearby. He had spent four months of his life at roughly this altitude, moving hand over hand through vacuum, bonding carbon ribbon to carbon ribbon while the station rotated slowly in the middle distance. He remembered the click of his radiation counter—a sound that had haunted his sleep for years afterward, that steady tick-tick-tick that meant you were absorbing something invisible, something that would find you later. He remembered the way his fingertips went numb inside the gloves no matter how he adjusted the heating, and the particular quality of silence when your own breathing was the only sound in the universe. He had watched supply shuttles come and go. He had counted the days until his shift ended and he could return to the surface, to Fatima, to the apartment where his children would eventually be born.

The station looked smaller than he remembered. Or perhaps he had grown larger—not in body, which had only broken down further in the years since, but in understanding. He knew now what the station represented: the permanent infrastructure of ascent, the machine that kept the wealthy rising while workers like him returned to the gravity well and stayed there.

"You've seen it before," Carlos said quietly, appearing at his shoulder. "Haven't you."

"From the outside." Yusuf's voice was flat. "Never from in here. Never as a passenger."

"Does it feel different?"

Yusuf considered the question. The viewport framed the station like a picture—beautiful, distant, contained. From inside the climber, with its climate control and its comfortable seating and its buffet of foods he had never been able to afford during construction, the station looked clean.

From the outside, in a pressure suit that was always slightly too tight, with radiation counters clicking warnings into his helmet, with the knowledge that one malfunction could send him spinning into the void—from the outside, the station had looked like a fortress. A place built by people like him, for people unlike him.

"It feels like a memory," he said finally. "One that belongs to someone else."

---

The crowd began to thin as the station fell behind them. Workers drifted back to their duties, their entertainment, their quiet contemplation of what it meant to be rising through the sky. Carlos stayed with Yusuf, saying nothing, his presence a comfort that didn't require words.

"The Chairman," Carlos said eventually. "Have you decided?"

Yusuf didn't answer immediately. He watched the last edge of the station disappear from the viewport's frame, swallowed by the angle of their ascent. Soon there would be nothing to see but tether and stars and the shrinking Earth below.

"I'll find him," he said. "Before we reach the hub."

"And then what?"

"I don't know." The honesty surprised him. He had carried the question for months—*Why did you send me the ticket?*—and he had imagined the confrontation a thousand times. In some versions, he raged. In others, he was cold, surgical, devastating. In a few, he simply asked and listened and walked away.

But now, at the mid-point, with the station receding and the hub growing ahead, he found that the question had changed shape. It was no longer about Kenji Murakami's guilt or Yusuf's anger. It was about something simpler and more impossible: understanding.

"He saved his own conscience," Carlos said. "By sending you. He gets to tell himself he did something."

"Maybe." Yusuf turned away from the viewport. "Or maybe he couldn't think of anything else to do. Maybe he's spent nineteen years looking for a way to fix what was broken, and this was the only door he could find."

"You're being generous."

Yusuf didn't answer. He began moving toward the corridor, his steps careful in the reduced gravity. Generous. Maybe. Or maybe he was just tired of the weight of his own anger, and looking for a way to set it down that didn't feel like losing.

He didn't know. That was the truth. At the midpoint of everything, he didn't know what he wanted from the man who had sent him here.

## III.

Miriam found the engineering section at 1100, guided by crew members who recognized her name and deferred to her credentials with varying degrees of unease.

The space was smaller than she had expected—a control room rather than a workspace, filled with monitors and consoles and the quiet hum of systems performing their endless calculations. Two crew members looked up as she entered: a young woman with the insignia of a systems engineer, and an older man whose gray hair and weathered hands suggested decades of practical experience.

"Dr. Okonkwo." The woman rose, uncertain whether to offer her hand or stand at attention. "We weren't expecting—is there something wrong?"

"Nothing wrong." Miriam scanned the monitors automatically, reading the data streams the way she had once read them daily—oscillation patterns, thermal gradients, climber velocity against altitude. "I wanted to see the mid-point passage from here. If that's permitted."

The engineers exchanged glances. The older man—his nameplate read KOWALSKI—nodded slowly.

"It's permitted," he said. "Though there's not much to see. The station is just a blip on the ranging data. The interesting readings are all internal."

"I know." Miriam moved closer to the central console, where the tether's real-time status was displayed in cascading visualizations. "That's why I'm here."

She had felt the shudder the day before—the brief harmonic event that the official communications had dismissed as "within parameters." The dismissal was accurate but incomplete. Within parameters meant the dampening systems had engaged successfully. It didn't mean the event was understood.

"You felt it," Kowalski said. It wasn't a question.

"Yes."

"We've run the analysis three times." He pulled up a secondary display, and columns of data scrolled past. "The factors were unusual but not unprecedented. Solar thermal expansion steeper than the model predicted. Traffic pattern altered by the maiden voyage schedule. Lunar tidal forces at maximum." He shrugged. "The system handled it."

"The system slowed the climber."

"Standard response. Reduce velocity, reduce energy input, let the oscillations dissipate naturally."

"And the oscillations increased anyway." Miriam touched the display, highlighting a specific data sequence. "For ninety seconds after the velocity reduction, amplitude continued to climb. Then the secondary dampening engaged—the active counterpulse—and the trend reversed."

Kowalski was quiet for a moment, studying the data she had highlighted. The young engineer, nameplate OYELARAN, leaned in to look as well.

"We attributed that to lag," Kowalski said finally. "The initial reduction takes time to propagate through the system. The continued increase was residual momentum."

"Or the reduction moved us closer to resonance rather than away from it." Miriam's voice was careful, precise—the voice she had used in engineering meetings thirty years ago, when the stakes were too high for diplomacy. "The maiden voyage climber is traveling slower than cargo climbers. Ceremonial pace, the manifest calls it. But our velocity through the 8,000-to-14,000-kilometer band placed the drive frequency within 3% of the altered natural frequency of that section."

She watched them process this—watched the understanding arrive, delayed but inevitable, in faces that had been trained to trust the systems rather than question them.

"The system's standard response," Oyelaran said slowly, "is to slow down when oscillations increase."

"Yes."

"But if slowing down moves us closer to resonance—"

"Then the standard response makes things worse." Miriam stepped back from the console. "We're through the danger zone now. The mid-point station damped the oscillations. Enough to buy us margin. But on the approach to geostationary—" She hesitated. "There are other sections with similar vulnerability. If the factors align again, if the automated systems respond by slowing down—"

"Then we accelerate into a cascade." Kowalski's voice was flat, the words landing like stones.

"The math is always right." Miriam heard the bitterness in her own voice and didn't bother to hide it. Thirty years of believing that, and look where it had brought them. "The question is whether we've correctly identified all the variables. We never do."

---

She left the engineering section an hour later, carrying data files she had been permitted to copy and questions she had not been permitted to ask. The crew would monitor the sections she had identified. The Captain would be briefed. Contingency protocols would be reviewed.

But the fundamental problem remained: the automated systems had been designed by people who believed slowing down was always safer than speeding up. The assumption was built into the architecture, encoded into responses that would engage automatically if conditions warranted. To change that assumption would require authorization from the Consortium's engineering oversight committee. She had seen their docket. Eighteen months of backlog. Review cycles measured in quarters.

They had four days.

Miriam walked the corridors toward her cabin, moving carefully in the reduced gravity, thinking about systems and assumptions and the ways that good engineering could become dangerous engineering when the world changed around it.

She thought about Zara Chen-Okafor—the young physicist whose algorithm had refined the very systems Miriam had created. There was potential there, and intelligence, and the particular kind of stubborn integrity that might actually survive contact with the Consortium's machinery.

She thought about Yusuf Haddad, somewhere in the economy sections, carrying questions she wasn't sure she could answer.

She thought about Teiti Nakibae, and the names of the dead, and the ceremony that was coming.

And she thought about the mid-point station, receding behind them now, falling away into the darkness between worlds—the last easy point of return, already past.

---

## IV.

The announcement came at 1430, broadcast to every cabin and common area aboard the climber.

*"Passengers and crew, this is Captain Osei. We have officially passed the mid-point of our journey. From this position, the orbital hub and the surface of Earth are equidistant—approximately 18,000 kilometers in each direction. We will continue our ascent at the current rate and expect to arrive at the hub in approximately four days.*

*"I want to thank you all for your cooperation and patience during this historic voyage. The maiden passage of the Babel Elevator represents decades of work by thousands of dedicated engineers, workers, and visionaries. We are privileged to be among the first to make this journey.*

*"Our next scheduled observation opportunity will be at 1800 ship time, when Earth's terminator will be visible from the main deck. Until then, please enjoy the facilities and don't hesitate to contact crew if you need assistance. Osei out."*

---

Teiti listened to the announcement from her bunk in the workers' quarters.

She had been lying awake since dawn, watching the stars through the narrow porthole beside her bed. The gravity here felt strange—lighter than Earth, heavier than water, somewhere between the world she had known and the world she was traveling toward. Her knees didn't ache as much. Her back, which had complained for thirty years, was almost silent.

*Halfway,* she thought. *The farthest any of us have been from the waters where we were born.*

She thought of the twelve I-Kiribati aboard—of Banuera, who had wept during the ceremony; of Toorua, who had pointed out the navigation stars and named them in the old way; of young Nei Teresia, who had never known Kiribati as anything but a story. They were all past the mid-point now. They were all committed to arrival.

And somewhere below them, invisible, the waters of the Phoenix Islands continued their slow death beneath the city that had been built on their grave.

Teiti reached for the photograph of Teriki—her husband, her anchor, her first loss in the long catalog of losses that had led to this moment. The photograph showed him young, smiling, standing on a beach that no longer existed. He was wearing the traditional *riri*, the men's dance skirt, and his feet were bare in white sand.

"Halfway, my love," she said quietly, in Gilbertese. "We are halfway to the place they built on your bones. The place they denied you."

The photograph didn't answer. It never did. But Teiti had long since learned that speaking to the dead was not about receiving answers. It was about refusing to let the silence win.

She tucked the photograph back into her bag and rose from her bunk. The gravity made her feel lighter than she had in years—strong, almost, the way she had felt when she was young and could dive to the reef's bottom on a single breath.

There was work to do. The ceremony in four days would require preparation—the names to be spoken, the songs to be sung, the witnesses to be gathered. She would need to speak with the Captain about using the chapel. She would need to coordinate with Banuera and the others. She would need to decide what words to speak at the arrival, when the Consortium gave her the platform they expected her to use for gratitude.

But first, she would go to the observation deck. She would watch the Earth, smaller now than it had ever been in her life, and she would look for the waters where the reef once lived.

She would not see them—the distance was too great, the clouds too thick, the city too massive. But she would look anyway.

That was what it meant to witness: to look even when there was nothing left to see.

---

## V.

Day three ended in artificial twilight.

The climber dimmed its lights according to a schedule designed to maintain human circadian rhythms. The actual passage of time had become meaningless here. There was no sun to set, no horizon to cross, no darkness that wasn't eternal. The passengers adjusted as best they could, some clinging to the imposed schedule, others drifting into personal rhythms that had nothing to do with Earth's rotation.

Zara lay in her bunk, tablet propped against her knees, reviewing the data she had requested from the engineering section. Oscillation patterns. Thermal gradients. The mathematics of a system designed by someone who had once believed, as Zara still believed, that elegance could save the world.

The data showed what Dr. Okonkwo had described: the brief spike in amplitude that the automated systems had misread, the counterproductive slowdown, the intervention of factors—the mid-point station's mass, the angle of solar heating—that had prevented cascade. Luck, as much as engineering. The system had worked, but it had worked by accident rather than design.

*Making things work in practice,* Miriam had said. *That's the harder part.*

Zara closed the data files and turned to her personal notes—the journal she had been keeping since boarding, filled with observations and questions and the occasional attempt at poetry. She scrolled past entries about the view, about Tomoko's wonder, about David the PR handler and his relentlessly cheerful management of their "experience."

She found a blank page and began to write.

*Day 3. Mid-point.*

*Spoke with Miriam Okonkwo. The architect. She's angrier than I expected. Less certain. That made me trust her more.*

*I keep thinking about Teiti Nakibae. The way she looked at me. Like she could see something I'm still pretending isn't there.*

*Here's what I haven't told anyone: part of me is relieved that my parents can't follow me here. Part of me likes being the exception. Likes being special. That's ugly. That's the part the scholarship was designed to cultivate—the part that stops identifying with the people left behind and starts identifying with the system that lifted you out.*

*I don't want to be that person. But wanting isn't the same as not being.*

*I need to listen to the people Miriam mentioned. Teiti. Diallo. The workers. Not to what they want me to do—but to what they remember. And I need to notice which parts of myself want to look away.*

Zara saved the entry and set the tablet aside. Through the porthole, the stars burned steady and cold. Somewhere below, Earth turned in its ancient rhythm. Somewhere ahead, the orbital hub waited, growing larger with every passing hour.

She closed her eyes and let the reduced gravity hold her, floating in the space between one world and another.

The hum of the climber shifted, and her stomach tightened before she knew why. Then it steadied.

Halfway.

Outside, unnoticed, a single running light on the tether flickered twice and went dark. In the engineering section, a diagnostic subroutine logged the anomaly and flagged it for next shift review.

---

*End of Day Three. Altitude: 18,400 kilometers. Days remaining: 4.*
