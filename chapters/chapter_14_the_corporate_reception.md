# Chapter 14: The Corporate Reception

The Lindqvist family had been hosting receptions for three generations, and Henrik had learned the craft the way other children learned piano or tennis—through repetition, correction, and the unspoken understanding that excellence was simply expected.

The VIP lounge occupied the forward section of Level 16, a sweep of curved transparency that commanded the best view on the climber. Earth hung in the ports like an installation, blue and cloud-swirled, while the tether stretched above and below them, a ribbon of silver fire connecting world to void. The lighting had been calibrated to complement the view: warm but not yellow, bright enough for conversation but dim enough to let the stars compete. The champagne was a 2078 Krug, brought aboard at considerable expense. The canapés were prepared by Chef Marchetti, recruited from the orbital hub's finest restaurant specifically for the maiden voyage.

Henrik moved through the room like water finding its level—smooth, unhurried, arriving precisely where the currents of influence converged.

"The projections for Q3 look extraordinary," he said to Klaus Richter, letting his voice carry just enough warmth to suggest genuine interest. "The lithium extraction figures alone—"

"We're seeing unprecedented efficiency," Richter agreed, swirling his champagne with the satisfaction of a man whose bets were paying off. "The microgravity processing opens possibilities we couldn't have imagined five years ago."

Henrik nodded, filing the information away, already thinking three moves ahead. The European Space Agency consortium was positioning for a major hub expansion, and Richter's company held the composite manufacturing contracts. An alliance here could mean preferred vendor status for Lindqvist Orbital's habitat construction division. Not tonight—tonight was for seeding, not harvesting—but the groundwork mattered.

He excused himself gracefully and moved on, pausing to greet Senator Gutierrez with a joke about her committee's recent hearings, exchanging pleasantries with Ambassador Laurent about the Parisian weather, accepting congratulations from Dr. Mensah on Lindqvist Orbital's recent safety certification.

The room was full of people he knew—or knew of, or needed to know. Consortium board members clustered near the observation ports, their conversations carefully pitched below the ambient music. Corporate executives circulated in loose orbits, their paths intersecting and diverging according to algorithms of interest and opportunity. Politicians moved among them like chess pieces, their positions on the board defined by the deals they could broker and the constituencies they could deliver.

This was Henrik's world. He had been raised in it, trained for it, made for it. The ease he felt here was not performance—or if it was performance, it had long ago become indistinguishable from his actual self. He belonged.

"Henrik." Erik Holmgren appeared at his elbow, tablet discreetly angled. "The Hashimoto delegation is asking about the timeline for the joint venture discussion."

"Tomorrow afternoon. After the mid-morning briefings."

"They're pushing for earlier."

"Then they're more eager than they want us to know." Henrik smiled. "Tomorrow afternoon. Perhaps we'll even make them wait until drinks."

Erik nodded and faded back into the crowd—his CFO, reliable as gravity, keeping the machinery of business running while Henrik worked the room. Anna Bergström was somewhere nearby as well, probably monitoring the press pool, ensuring that the photographers captured the right moments and missed the ones that required privacy.

He paused at the bar for a fresh glass—not because he wanted one, but because the bar was a natural gathering point, a place where conversations could begin without the weight of intention.

The bartender was a young man with dark hair and a pleasant, professional expression. Filipino, perhaps, or Indonesian. He poured the champagne with practiced efficiency and offered it with a slight bow.

"Sir."

Henrik accepted the glass without really seeing him. He was already scanning the room, cataloging positions, calculating trajectories. Lin Xiaoming had arrived and was holding court near the aft observation port, surrounded by a clutch of Asian executives whose presence suggested that whatever deal he was pitching had serious backing. Yuki Hashimoto stood slightly apart, watching Lin with the particular attention of a rival assessing the competition. Sarah Chen was talking to Admiral Crawford, which was interesting—she rarely wasted time on military contacts unless she was positioning for defense contracts.

And there, near the entrance, the scholarship students.

---

They arrived in a cluster, twelve young people in their best professional attire, shepherded by David from the Stellar Foundation with his tablet and his earpiece and his carefully managed schedule. Henrik watched them enter—the way they paused at the threshold, taking in the room, their faces cycling through variations of awe and uncertainty and determination.

He knew their names. He had reviewed their files during the planning phase, when the scholarship program was still a line item in the corporate social responsibility budget rather than a living cohort of human beings. Twelve students from twelve countries, selected through a process designed to identify exceptional potential and exceptional optics in roughly equal measure. They were the future, or at least a version of it—the narrative of meritocracy made visible, proof that access to orbit was not entirely determined by accident of birth.

He found himself watching one in particular.

Zara Chen-Okafor stood at the edge of the cohort, her posture different from the others. The Brazilian student—Fernanda, if he remembered correctly—was leaning forward, eager, ready to engage. The Japanese student—Kenji, an unfortunate coincidence of names—maintained perfect formal stillness. But Zara was doing something else: she was watching. Her eyes moved across the room with the particular attention of someone cataloging data, someone processing, someone thinking.

Henrik recognized the look. He had seen it in mirrors, in negotiating partners, in rivals worth respecting. It was the look of someone who understood that the room was a system, and systems could be read.

She caught him watching and met his gaze without flinching. A beat. Then she smiled—not the eager smile of a student seeking approval, but something more measured. An acknowledgment between players.

*Interesting*, Henrik thought. *Very interesting.*

He set his champagne aside and began moving toward the scholarship cohort.

---

"Ms. Chen-Okafor." He extended his hand with the warmth he reserved for promising investments. "Henrik Lindqvist. We met briefly at the staging area, but I don't believe we've had a proper conversation."

"Mr. Lindqvist." Her handshake was firm, professional, calibrated. "I remember. You mentioned my algorithm."

"The oscillation dampening model, yes. Dr. Mensah speaks highly of it. She says it's genuinely elegant—not just functional, but beautiful in its efficiency."

Something flickered in Zara's expression—pleasure, perhaps, at the technical recognition rather than the generic praise. "It's a small contribution to a very large system."

"All systems are built from small contributions." Henrik gestured toward the observation port, where Earth curved blue and perfect against the dark. "Every meter of that tether required someone to solve a specific problem. Your problem happened to be one that affected everything above it. That's not small."

"And your family's contribution?"

The question was direct—more direct than he expected from a scholarship recipient at a corporate event. Most of them knew to perform gratitude, to stay within the boundaries of their role. Zara was testing those boundaries.

Henrik found he didn't mind.

"Capital," he said. "And faith. My grandfather invested when the elevator was still science fiction. My father held position when everyone said it would never work. I inherited the benefits of their patience." He paused, offering honesty that was also strategy. "I didn't solve any equations. I was born into a family that could afford to wait for the future."

Zara considered this. "That's more honest than most people in this room would be."

"Most people in this room are still performing. I find that exhausting after the first hour." He smiled. "Besides, you strike me as someone who sees through performances. Better to save us both the effort."

"Is that what you tell all your scholarship investments?"

"Only the ones who might actually change something." He turned slightly, including her in his view of the room. "What do you see, when you look at this?"

She didn't answer immediately. Her eyes moved across the crowd—the executives, the politicians, the servers circulating with their trays.

"A system," she said finally. "Everyone here has a role. Everyone here is exchanging something—access, influence, validation. The room looks like a party, but it's actually a market."

"And what are you exchanging?"

"I'm still figuring that out." She looked at him directly. "What are *you* exchanging, Mr. Lindqvist?"

Henrik laughed—genuinely, which surprised him. "Tonight? Mostly social credit. I host a reception; people remember the hospitality when I need a favor. It's basic relationship maintenance." He paused. "But the larger exchange? I'm trading capital for position in the orbital economy. Betting that what my grandfather started will still be valuable in another generation."

"And if it's not?"

"Then I'll have spent a very pleasant life being wrong about the future." He raised his glass slightly. "There are worse fates."

A handler materialized at Zara's elbow—David, with his tablet and his apologetic expression. "Ms. Chen-Okafor, Senator Gutierrez has asked to meet the scholarship cohort—"

"Of course." Zara's professional mask slid back into place, smooth and practiced. She turned to Henrik with a nod that was almost collegial. "Thank you for the conversation, Mr. Lindqvist. It was... illuminating."

"For me as well." He watched her go, rejoining her cohort, transforming back into a scholarship student for whatever photo opportunity awaited.

*She'll be something*, he thought. *In ten years, she'll be in rooms like this without anyone's sponsorship.*

The thought pleased him. This was what the scholarship program was supposed to produce—not just good optics, but actual talent. Actual disruption. The future needed people like Zara Chen-Okafor, people who could see through the performances and still play the game.

He made a mental note to ensure she had opportunities after the voyage. Internship placements, mentorship connections, the quiet machinery of access that separated potential from achievement. She had earned his investment tonight. He would see that it paid returns.

Miriam Okonkwo stood near the aft observation port, holding a glass of mineral water she hadn't touched.

She had not wanted to come. The invitation had arrived through official channels—Distinguished Guest Reception, VIP Lounge, attendance encouraged—and she had spent forty minutes composing a polite refusal before deleting it unsent. She was aboard this climber to see what she had built, to reckon with what it had cost, not to sip champagne with the people who had profited from both.

But staying in her cabin felt like hiding. And Miriam Okonkwo had stopped hiding the day she left the Consortium.

So she had dressed in the closest thing to formal wear she'd packed—a dark blue jacket over practical trousers—and made her way to Level 16, and now she stood at the edge of the room, watching the party she had no part in.

The engineering was beautiful, at least. The observation port was a masterwork of composite materials, the curve of transparency precisely calculated to maximize viewing angle while maintaining structural integrity. She had signed off on the specifications herself, years ago, when the climber was still a sheaf of blueprints and an impossible dream.

Now she stood inside her blueprints and felt like a ghost at her own funeral.

"Dr. Okonkwo." A voice beside her, warm and professional. She turned to find a tall man with silver-blond hair and the kind of smile that reached his eyes because he had practiced until it did.

"Mr. Lindqvist." She did not offer her hand.

"I'm glad you could join us." He moved to stand beside her, facing the view rather than the room. "The observation ports were your design, weren't they? The load distribution calculations?"

"Among others."

"It's extraordinary work. The view is—" He paused, and something in his expression shifted. "I was about to say 'worth the investment,' but that sounds crass. The truth is, I don't have words for what the view is. I'm not sure anyone does."

Miriam looked at the Earth, hanging in the dark. Blue and white and heartbreakingly small. Everything she had ever known, reduced to a marble.

"The view isn't the problem," she said.

"No?"

"The view is transcendent. The view changes everyone who sees it." She turned to look at him directly. "The problem is who gets to see it. And who paid for the privilege."

Henrik's smile didn't falter, but something behind it recalculated. "You're talking about the workers."

"I'm talking about everyone who was promised this and didn't receive it. The construction crews who were told their contracts would include passage. The communities displaced to build the anchor city. The families of the 1,247 who died." She watched his face for a reaction. "You know that number, don't you? 1,247."

"I know it." His voice was careful now, the easy charm replaced by something more guarded. "I also know that the Consortium has made significant efforts toward compensation and memorial—"

"The Consortium has made significant efforts toward managing liability." Miriam heard the edge in her own voice and didn't soften it. "I was there for the negotiations, Mr. Lindqvist. I sat in rooms where lawyers calculated the acceptable cost per death. I watched them weigh public relations against legal exposure and call it corporate responsibility."

The silence stretched between them. Around them, the party continued—glasses clinking, laughter rising, the machinery of influence humming along. But here, at the edge of the room, something had cracked.

"I don't disagree with you," Henrik said finally. "Not entirely. The system is flawed. The distribution is unjust. I benefit from structures I didn't create and can't easily change." He met her eyes. "But I'm not sure what you want me to do about it. Refuse my inheritance? Walk away from the investments that support thousands of jobs? Pretend that my leaving would make the system more just rather than simply making me feel more virtuous?"

"I want you to see it." Miriam's voice was quiet now. "That's all. I want you to see what the champagne costs. I want you to know the names of the people who died so you could stand here, and to carry that knowledge when you make your deals and manage your investments." She looked back at the view. "I don't expect you to change. I don't expect anyone to change. But I want you to *know*."

Henrik was silent for a long moment. When he spoke, his voice had lost its practiced smoothness.

"I met a woman on the observation deck this morning. An elder—I-Kiribati, I think. She was looking at the Pacific, and I couldn't tell what she was seeing." He paused. "She was the same woman who corrected the death count at a briefing. Said the number was 1,247, not 847. Made everyone uncomfortable and walked away before anyone could respond."

"Teiti Nakibae." Miriam's voice was soft. "Her husband was one of the twenty-three who died in the anchor collapse. She's been organizing worker memorials for twenty years."

"I didn't know her name." Something in Henrik's expression flickered—not guilt, exactly, but something adjacent to it. "I noticed her, but I didn't know who she was. I didn't—" He stopped. Started again. "I didn't see her. Not really. I saw an image. Local color. A data point."

"That's the problem, Mr. Lindqvist." Miriam set her untouched water on a passing server's tray. "We're all very good at seeing images. We're much less practiced at seeing people."

She left him standing at the observation port and made her way toward the exit. The party continued behind her—glasses clinking, deals forming, the system perpetuating itself. But something had shifted in the room's architecture, something invisible and possibly temporary.

A crack, perhaps. Or just the pressure of altitude.

---

Henrik watched her go and found himself unable to return to the easy rhythm of the reception.

The room was the same—the same conversations, the same calculations, the same currents of influence he had navigated his entire life. But something had changed in how he saw it. The server who had poured his champagne passed by, collecting empty glasses, and Henrik found himself noting the man's face for the first time. Young. Tired around the eyes. A small scar on his chin that might have been a childhood accident or might have been something else entirely.

*Who are you?* The question surfaced unbidden. *What's your name? What did you give up to be here, serving drinks to people who don't see you?*

The thought was uncomfortable. Henrik dismissed it—or tried to. But it lingered, like a splinter under the skin, barely noticeable until you pressed on it.

He forced himself back into motion, rejoining the flow of the party. Lin Xiaoming was discussing satellite manufacturing with a group of investors; Henrik inserted himself smoothly, offering commentary that was informed without being aggressive, positioning without claiming. Sarah Chen had moved on from Admiral Crawford and was now talking to Dr. Johansson about environmental monitoring systems; Henrik filed the information away. Yuki Hashimoto caught his eye across the room and raised a glass in ironic salute; Henrik returned it, acknowledging the rivalry without escalating it.

The machinery worked. It always worked. He knew the steps, the rhythms, the unspoken rules. He could do this in his sleep.

But the server passed by again, and Henrik noticed him again, and the noticing felt different now.

*I didn't see her. Not really.*

He thought about Zara Chen-Okafor, watching the room with her cataloging eyes. He thought about Miriam Okonkwo, standing at the edge, carrying the weight of 1,247 deaths. He thought about the I-Kiribati elder—Teiti Nakibae, he knew her name now—searching for a reef that no longer existed.

He thought about his grandfather, who had invested in a dream of towers reaching to heaven.

*What did you see, Grandfather? What did you know about the cost?*

The question had never occurred to him before. His grandfather's story was about vision, about faith, about the rewards of patient capital. There had never been a chapter about who paid for the patience, whose faith was never rewarded, whose vision was erased to make room for the tower.

"Mr. Lindqvist?" Erik was at his elbow again, tablet ready. "Crown Prince Rashid would like a word about the UAE partnership proposals."

"Of course." Henrik straightened his jacket, assembled his professional expression. "Lead the way."

He moved back into the party, back into the system, back into the only role he had ever known. The conversations continued. The deals progressed. The champagne flowed.

But something had cracked, and he could feel the pressure of it against his smooth surface, looking for a way in.

---

Dr. Anika Johansson found him an hour later, near the secondary bar, where he had retreated to collect himself.

She was a fellow Swede—he had known her slightly before the voyage, through the interlocking networks of Nordic corporate society. She served as the Consortium's Chief Sustainability Officer, a title that had once sounded like greenwashing and still might be, though word was she had stayed in the role longer than anyone expected and fought harder than the position required.

"Henrik." She stood beside him without preamble, looking out at the Earth through the nearest port. "Quite a gathering."

"We try to impress."

"You succeed." Her voice was dry. "All the right people, all the right conversations. The future being negotiated over canapés."

"Is there a better venue?"

"Probably not." She was quiet for a moment. "I saw you talking with Miriam Okonkwo earlier. She seemed... direct."

"She's earned the right to be direct."

"Mmm." Anika turned slightly, including him in her attention without making the conversation feel like a confrontation. "I've been reading the worker compensation files, as part of my sustainability review. The environmental impacts of the anchor city, the displacement figures, the health outcomes for construction crews."

Henrik felt the splinter press deeper. "And?"

"And I'm wondering what we tell ourselves. When we stand in rooms like this, drinking champagne that costs more than a worker makes in a month, celebrating achievements that were built on—" She paused. "On what, exactly? On whose labor? On whose sacrifice?"

"You sound like Dr. Okonkwo."

"Perhaps she and I have been reading the same files." Anika's voice was mild, but her eyes were sharp. "The question I keep asking myself: Is this sustainable? Not the engineering—the engineering is brilliant. But the system. The economy of access. The distribution of benefits and costs." She looked at him directly. "Does the math work, Henrik? Long-term? When the workers' children grow up and realize what was taken from them? When the displaced communities organize and demand restitution? When the bill comes due for forty years of deferred promises?"

Henrik wanted to deflect. He had a dozen responses ready—the standard defenses, the familiar frames, the ways of acknowledging criticism without accepting responsibility. He had used them countless times, in rooms exactly like this one, with questions exactly like these.

But the splinter pressed, and the words wouldn't come.

"I don't know," he said. The honesty surprised him. "I've never thought about the math that way."

"Maybe it's time to start." Anika set her own glass aside. "The lottery system was supposed to be the answer—democratized access, a chance for everyone. But you know what the odds are? A hundred million people applied for this voyage. Five hundred were selected. That's not democracy. That's a distraction dressed up as opportunity."

"What would you suggest instead?"

"I don't know yet. But I know that 'better than nothing' isn't the same as 'good enough.'" She straightened, preparing to return to the party. "Think about it, Henrik. You're clever. You have resources. You have position. Maybe you can figure out an answer the rest of us have missed."

She walked away, leaving him alone with the view and the question and the crack that kept spreading.

---

The reception wound down slowly, the way corporate gatherings always did—guests departing in waves, conversations concluding with promises to continue, the energy of the room settling from performance into exhaustion.

Henrik stayed until the end, as host. He shook hands, exchanged farewells, accepted compliments on the event. He was gracious with Senator Gutierrez, collegial with Klaus Richter, appropriately deferential to Dr. Mensah. He played his role perfectly, as he always did.

But when the last guests had gone and the servers were clearing the remnants, he found himself alone at the observation port, looking at the Earth.

The view was transcendent. Miriam had been right about that. Blue and white and impossibly beautiful, the planet that held everything—every market, every asset, every relationship that defined his position in the world. From here, the divisions were invisible. The workers' quarter and the corporate towers, the protests and the profits, the 1,247 dead and the 500 passengers—all of it reduced to pattern, to abstraction, to the simple geometry of a sphere in the void.

He thought about Teiti Nakibae, searching for a reef that had been destroyed to build the platform beneath his feet. He thought about Miriam Okonkwo, carrying the weight of decisions she couldn't take back. He thought about Zara Chen-Okafor, navigating a system she already understood better than most people twice her age.

He thought about the server whose name he didn't know, whose face he had noticed once and forgotten twice.

*What do you see, when you look at this?*

The question he had asked Zara, turned back on himself.

He saw beauty. He saw opportunity. He saw the fruits of his grandfather's faith and his father's patience and his own careful stewardship of inherited advantage.

But now, pressing against that vision like a crack in a viewport, he saw something else. A shadow. A cost. A ledger with entries he had never bothered to read.

He didn't know what to do with it. He didn't know if there was anything to do—if seeing the shadow changed anything, if awareness was action or just another form of privilege. He suspected that tomorrow, in the bright light of meetings and negotiations, the crack would seal itself, the splinter would be absorbed, and he would return to the easy rhythm that had always defined him.

But tonight, alone with the view, he let himself feel it.

The discomfort. The uncertainty. The first faint pressure of a question he had never thought to ask.

*The view is transcendent. The problem is who gets to see it.*

Henrik stood at the observation port, champagne warm and flat in his hand, and watched the Earth turn beneath him.

Tomorrow, there would be deals. Negotiations. The machinery of access, grinding forward.

But tonight, just for a moment, he let the crack spread.

He let himself not know.
