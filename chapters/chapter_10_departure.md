# Chapter 10: Departure

The climber was still.

Miriam stood at the observation port in the distinguished guest lounge, her hand pressed flat against the glass, waiting. Around her, dignitaries and executives murmured in the particular hush that precedes ceremony—champagne held but not drunk, conversations started but not finished. Through the port, Te Rarawa spread below in its familiar rings of light, the Ascension District blazing at the center, the outer sprawl guttering toward darkness. The tether rose above them, silver against the deepening blue, and descended below into the terminal's embrace.

She had designed this moment. Not the ceremony, not the champagne, but the physics of it—the sequence of electromagnetic engagement, the careful calibration of acceleration, the structural dynamics that would carry five hundred people toward orbit. Three years on the acceleration curves alone, optimizing for passenger comfort without sacrificing efficiency. The numbers were elegant. The numbers were beautiful.

The numbers told her nothing about how it would feel.

"Distinguished passengers." The voice came through the lounge's speakers, warm and precise—Lieutenant Chen, the communications officer, her tone calibrated for reassurance. "The climber will begin its ascent in approximately three minutes. Please ensure you are seated or have secured a stable position. Observation ports will remain accessible throughout departure."

Three minutes. Miriam did not move from the window.

She had watched climbers depart before, from the ground. She had stood on the observation platform at the Consortium headquarters and tracked the slow-moving points of light ascending the tether, cargo runs and crew transfers and the private ascents of executives who could afford what workers could not. She had watched her designs carry tonnage into orbit and felt something that was almost pride, almost satisfaction, almost enough.

She had never ridden one.

For eight years since her departure from the Consortium, she had refused every invitation. The inaugural ceremonies, the milestone celebrations, the commemorative ascents—she had declined them all, citing health, citing schedule, citing anything that would let her avoid standing inside the structure she had helped create. She had told herself it was principle. She had told herself it was grief. She had not told herself the truth: that she was afraid of what she would feel when she finally rose.

Now she was here. Now there was nowhere left to hide.

Through the glass, the terminal's great hall was visible below—a cathedral of light and carbon fiber, crowded with the watchers who would remain behind. Journalists documenting the departure. Families saying goodbye. Workers whose labor had made this moment possible, gathered at the barriers to watch their betters ascend. From this height, they were indistinguishable. Faces turned upward, hands raised in farewell, a sea of humanity reduced to pattern and abstraction.

Miriam wondered how many of them hated her.

---

Yusuf felt the drive engage before anyone announced it.

The vibration changed—subtle, a shift in frequency that most passengers would never notice. But he had spent seven years inside structures like this one, had learned to read the language of machinery the way his grandfather read weather from the sea. The electromagnetic systems were warming, the drive wheels finding their grip on the ribbon, the whole vast apparatus of ascent preparing to move.

He stood in the economy observation alcove, a narrow space with a single port the size of a dinner plate. A lottery winner from Thailand had yielded the spot when he arrived—something in his face, perhaps, or the missing fingers, or the way he carried himself. The worker's deference to another worker, even in a space where they were supposed to be equals.

Through the small window, he could see the terminal's edge and, beyond it, the city. The Workers' Quarter was invisible from here—too far, too dim—but he knew where it was. He had walked those streets this morning, had passed the Shadow Memorial where 1,247 names waited in concrete for his return.

*I'm inside it now*, he thought. *The thing I built. The thing they said I'd never ride.*

The vibration deepened. A low hum rose through the deck plates, through his boots, through the bones of his legs and into his spine. The climber was preparing to move.

His right hand found the wall without thinking, palm flat against the composite surface. The vibration traveled through his skin, through the stumps where two fingers had been, through the scar tissue and the nerve damage and into something deeper. Memory. Recognition. The structure speaking in a language he had learned to hear.

*The rhythm is clean*, he noted automatically. *No flutter, no resonance. The systems are healthy.*

He had helped make them healthy. His hands had assembled components that were now carrying him upward. His labor was woven into the walls that surrounded him.

The announcement came—a woman's voice, professional and calm—but Yusuf barely heard it. He was listening to something older. The sound of the tether singing.

---

Zara's tablet displayed the acceleration data before she felt anything.

She had linked to the climber's public telemetry feed the moment boarding completed, pulling real-time metrics onto her screen: velocity, altitude, drive power, structural load. Now, as the departure sequence began, she watched the numbers change.

*0.12 m/s². Gentle. Building slowly.*

The physics was beautiful. The electromagnetic drive gripped the tether through induced currents, pulling the climber upward without the violence of chemical rockets. No explosive thrust, no crushing g-forces. Just a gradual, patient pull—the same force that would continue for five to seven days, carrying them from sea level to geostationary orbit.

She looked up from her tablet. Through the standard deck's observation window, Earth was beginning to move.

No—not Earth. Earth was where it had always been. The climber was moving. But the visual effect was the same: the terminal sliding downward, the city spreading, the curve of the Pacific becoming visible at the horizon's edge.

"Oh," said Fatou beside her. A small sound, almost a breath.

The scholarship students had gathered at the window—all four of them from their cabin, plus three others from the cohort. They stood in silence, tablets forgotten, watching the world rearrange itself.

Zara had seen photographs. She had watched footage. She had studied the orbital mechanics and calculated the trajectories and understood, intellectually, exactly what would happen during an elevator ascent. But understanding was not feeling. The numbers on her screen told her they were rising at less than half a meter per second—barely walking pace—yet the visual was transformative. The terminal was shrinking. The city was shrinking. The horizon was curving.

*This is real*, she thought. *I'm really going up.*

Her hand found Emma's without either of them looking. They stood together, scholarship recipients and corporate niece, watching the same miracle from adjacent worlds.

---

Henrik raised his glass.

"To vision," he said, though no one was close enough to hear.

The VIP lounge had the best view—floor-to-ceiling ports spanning thirty degrees of arc, the departure unfolding like a documentary filmed for his benefit. He stood at the center of the glass wall, champagne in hand, and watched the Ascension District fall away below.

The tether dominated the view above—a ribbon of silver fire in the afternoon light, stretching toward infinity. Below, the terminal had already become a geometric abstraction, its cathedral spaces reduced to angles and shadows. The city spread around it in concentric rings, each ring dimmer than the last, until the outer sprawl blurred into the Pacific's infinite blue.

Henrik had seen this view before, from the orbital hub, during his cargo inspection trip three years ago. But that had been a rocket ascent—brief, violent, commercial. This was different. This was slow enough to savor.

*Forty years of vision*, he thought. *Father's faith. Grandfather's capital. And here we are.*

The Lindqvist family had invested in the elevator when investment was still faith. His grandfather had looked at Yamazaki's proposals and seen not impossibility but opportunity—a ladder to markets that didn't yet exist, to resources that couldn't yet be reached. He had committed the family fortune when commitment was madness.

Now Henrik stood in the result, champagne in hand, and felt something that might have been gratitude, or might have been satisfaction, or might have been the particular pleasure of being proved right.

He sipped the champagne. Excellent vintage. Appropriate to the occasion.

Below, the Workers' Quarter was becoming invisible—too small, too dim, absorbed into the city's pattern. Henrik did not notice its disappearance.

---

Amara's camera captured everything.

She stood at the press room's observation port, recording the departure in high-definition—the terminal shrinking, the city spreading, the tether catching the light like a blade of silver. Standard footage. Required footage. The shots that would lead newscasts around the world.

But her eyes were elsewhere.

Through the port, she could see a section of the economy deck's exterior—a row of small windows, each one a dinner-plate circle of glass. In one of them, barely visible, a figure stood. Male, she thought. Stocky. Something wrong with his left hand.

Yusuf Haddad. She had memorized the passenger manifest. She knew where the workers had been assigned.

She held the camera steady on the official view—the tether, the city, the curve of the Earth beginning to emerge at the horizon. The footage would show humanity's triumph. The footage would show the miracle.

But Amara was watching the small window where a man who had built this structure was finally riding it, nineteen years after he should have.

*This is the story*, she thought. *Not the champagne. Not the dignitaries. The people who made it possible and were told they couldn't come.*

Her tablet buzzed. A message from her handler: *Great footage. Networks are picking up the live feed. Keep it coming.*

She kept the camera steady. She kept watching the small window. She kept thinking about the story she would eventually tell.

---

The intercom crackled.

"Good afternoon. This is Chairman Murakami."

Kenji's voice filled every corridor, every cabin, every observation deck of the climber. It reached the VIP lounges where dignitaries paused with champagne halfway to their lips. It reached the economy section where lottery winners pressed against windows. It reached the workers' alcove where Yusuf stood with his palm flat against the wall.

It reached everywhere, because that was what Chairman's remarks were supposed to do.

"On behalf of the Babel Consortium, I welcome you to this historic voyage."

Kenji stood in the command observation gallery, a small space adjacent to the bridge where he could speak without interfering with operations. Captain Osei was visible through the transparent partition, monitoring the ascent with the contained stillness of someone who had done this forty-seven times before. Her presence was reassuring. Her competence was beyond question.

His own presence felt like performance.

"For nearly four decades, humanity has worked toward this moment. The Babel Elevator represents our greatest achievement—not merely of engineering, but of cooperation. Nations that disagreed found common purpose. Individuals who might never have met contributed to a shared vision. What rises today is not simply a structure. It is a testament to what we can accomplish together."

The words were polished. Priya's team had drafted them, refined them, tested them for resonance and risk. He had approved them because they were true enough, because they were safe enough, because they were the words a Chairman should say.

They were not the words he wanted to say.

"Below us, the anchor city of Te Rarawa marks the gateway to this new frontier. Above us, the orbital hub awaits—a permanent human presence beyond Earth's atmosphere. And between them, the tether that carries us represents something more than carbon and ambition. It represents hope."

*Hope.* The word stuck in his throat. He thought of Yusuf, somewhere in the decks below. Of the ticket he had sent. Of the question that would eventually come: *Why?*

"This maiden voyage carries not only passengers but purpose. Among us are scientists and artists, diplomats and dreamers. Among us are workers whose hands built the very structure that now lifts us. Among us are lottery winners who represent humanity's collective aspiration to reach beyond our world."

*Among us are those we promised and betrayed*, he did not say. *Among us are the ones we told could never come.*

"As we ascend, I invite you to look at the world you're leaving—not with farewell, but with new eyes. The Babel Elevator offers more than transportation. It offers perspective. And perspective, we hope, offers understanding."

He paused. The prepared remarks had one more paragraph—something about the future, about humanity's destiny among the stars. He had read it a dozen times. He could deliver it from memory.

Instead, he said: "Thank you for joining us. May the journey be all that you hoped, and more than you expected."

The intercom clicked off. The final paragraph remained unspoken.

Captain Osei glanced at him through the partition. Her expression revealed nothing. She turned back to her instruments and monitored the ascent.

Kenji stood alone in the observation gallery, watching Earth recede through the port, and wondered if anyone had heard what he hadn't said.

---

Miriam felt the first hour pass in heartbeats.

The VIP lounge had emptied around her—dignitaries drifting toward the reception, toward the business of being seen and seeing. She remained at the window, watching the world transform.

Te Rarawa was a pattern now, not a place. The rings of light had become concentric abstractions, the Ascension District indistinguishable from the sprawl. The Pacific spread around it, vast and blue, and the curve of the Earth was unmistakable at the horizon's edge.

She had calculated this view. She knew exactly how the planet would appear from each altitude, had generated simulations and projections and visual models during the design phase. But the simulations hadn't captured what it felt like to watch her calculations become reality.

The tether stretched above and below, silver fire in both directions. Below, it descended toward the anchor that held it to the Earth—the anchor she had spent five years designing, whose foundations reached deep into the seabed where a reef had once lived. Above, it rose toward infinity, toward the mid-point station and the high-altitude platforms and the orbital hub she had helped design but never visited.

She had made this. The mathematics were hers. The oscillation solution that allowed the tether to remain stable under impossible stresses—that was hers.

And the cost was hers too.

She had known. Known the corners being cut, the warnings ignored, the 1,247 names that would eventually be carved into the Shadow Memorial. She had raised concerns and been overruled and stayed anyway, until staying became unbearable. Then she had left, and the structure had kept rising without her, and now she was inside it—finally riding the thing she had made possible and fled.

The intercom chimed. A steward's voice, gentle and practiced: "The departure reception will begin in fifteen minutes in the Grand Atrium. All passengers are invited to attend."

Miriam didn't move. She wasn't ready for the reception. She wasn't ready for the handshakes and the recognition and the questions that would circle around the one question no one would actually ask: *Was it worth it?*

She pressed her forehead to the glass, feeling its cool smoothness, feeling the vibration of the drive through the structure, feeling everything she had made and everything it had cost.

Below, the Earth continued to curve. Above, the stars were beginning to emerge from the darkening sky.

---

Teiti sang.

The song was old—older than the elevator, older than the Consortium, older than the Compact that had traded her homeland for humanity's ladder. Her grandmother had taught it to her mother, and her mother had taught it to her, in a time when the Phoenix Islands were still islands and not a construction platform, when the reef was still alive and the fish were still so thick you could walk on their backs.

*"Te mauri, te raoi, ao te tabomoa..."*

The words were Gilbertese, the language of her childhood, the language she still thought in when thought became too heavy for English. Health, peace, and prosperity. The blessing for travelers, for those crossing water, for those leaving home.

She stood at the small window of her cabin in the economy section—number 7, a space no larger than the quarters she had shared with Teriki in the construction years. Her bunkmates were elsewhere, probably at the observation deck, probably pressing against the windows with all the others. She had chosen to stay here, in the narrow space, with the small porthole that showed only a slice of the world below.

Through the window, she could see the Pacific.

Not the Pacific as the maps named it—not the basin that held a quarter of Earth's water. She could see only a fragment, a curve of blue interrupted by clouds. But somewhere in that blue, invisible from any height, lay the waters where the Phoenix Islands had been.

Kanton. Enderbury. Birnie. McKean. Rawaki. Manra. Orona. Nikumaroro.

Names that meant nothing to the passengers above her, names that were not on any tourist map or travel brochure. Names of islands that had been submerged or landfilled or incorporated into the anchor city's spreading foundation. Names of places where her grandfather had fished and her mother had swum and her husband had learned the diving skills that would eventually kill him.

The reef was down there somewhere. Not the reef—the ghost of it. Buried under concrete and carbon fiber, drowned in sediment from the dredging, poisoned by the thermal pollution of humanity's greatest machine. The coral that had grown for ten thousand years, centimeter by centimeter, had been scraped away in a decade to make room for progress.

She had helped. That was the wound she carried. She had worked the construction crews, had placed components in the anchor platform, had watched the reef die and kept working because the money was good and Teriki believed in the promises and what choice did they have, really, when Tarawa was drowning and the Compact offered survival?

She had helped build the tower that killed her husband.

Now she was rising inside it, carried upward by the labor of thousands like her, ascending the structure that had cost everything and promised so little in return.

*"Te mauri, te raoi, ao te tabomoa..."*

The song continued, low and steady, a thread of memory in a vessel of ambition. She was not singing for the passengers above her, the ones with champagne and observation decks and the luxury of awe uncomplicated by loss. She was singing for Teriki. For the reef. For all the fish that no longer existed.

She was singing a departure song, because that was what you did when you left home.

Even when home no longer existed.

---

The first hour ended with darkness.

Not true darkness—the climber's interior remained bright, its lighting systems mimicking Earth normal. But through the observation ports, the sky had transformed. Blue had deepened to indigo, indigo to black. The stars emerged, first a few, then dozens, then hundreds—more than any city-dweller had ever seen, more than the light-polluted skies of Earth had shown in decades.

And below, the planet itself had changed.

Te Rarawa was invisible now, absorbed into the lights of the Pacific Rim. The ocean spread beneath them, vast and dark, interrupted by the scattered glows of shipping lanes and the brighter clusters of island nations. The curve of the Earth was unmistakable. The atmosphere showed as a thin blue line at the horizon, fragile and finite, the only barrier between the world's warmth and the void's cold.

Miriam saw it from the VIP observation deck, where she had finally emerged from her solitary watching. Henrik saw it from the Grand Atrium, where the reception had paused as passengers drifted toward the windows. Zara saw it from the standard deck's common area, her tablet forgotten, her physics calculations abandoned for the reality of what physics had made possible.

Amara recorded it, her camera steady, her eyes wet.

Yusuf saw it from the economy alcove, his hand still pressed to the wall, his body still reading the structure's health through the vibration in his bones. The view struck him silent. He had spent seven years building this machine. He had never truly believed he would see what it showed.

Kenji saw it from his suite, alone, the Chairman's reception continuing somewhere below him without his presence. He had excused himself with practiced grace—fatigue, preparation, the duties of office. In truth, he had needed to see this privately. To see the world from above, as Takeshi had always wanted him to. To ask himself, in the silence of the ascending vessel, whether any of it had been worth the cost.

He did not have an answer. But the question, at least, was clearer.

And Teiti saw it from her small window, her song finished, her hands folded in her lap. The Pacific spread below her, the waters where her homeland had been swallowed by shadow and distance. She could not see the reef. She would never see the reef again. But she knew where it was, in the darkness below, and she spoke to it as she had spoken to Teriki at the Shadow Memorial.

*I am rising*, she told the dead. *I am rising in the tower built on your grave. And I will carry you with me, every kilometer, until I can speak your names in the place they denied you.*

The climber continued upward. The stars multiplied. The Earth shrank slowly, patiently, becoming something other than ground—becoming a place that could be seen whole, that could be comprehended entire, that could be held in the eye like a marble or a memory.

Five hundred passengers, seventy-five crew, one structure of carbon and ambition. Rising through the darkness toward an orbital dawn.

And somewhere below, growing smaller with each passing moment, the world they had left behind continued turning without them—the protests and the workers and the names carved in concrete, the promises kept and broken, the shadow that no amount of altitude could dispel.
