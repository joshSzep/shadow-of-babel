# Chapter 2: The Queue

The apartment was still dark when Yusuf opened his eyes, but he could see the tether through the window—he could always see the tether—its running lights pulsing slow and patient against the pre-dawn black. Red, white, red, white. A heartbeat for something that had no heart.

He lay still, listening. Fatima's breathing beside him, soft and even. Down the hall, the children in their shared room, Omar's occasional mumble as he dreamed. The hum of the city beneath it all, that constant low vibration that lived in the walls and floors of every structure in Te Rarawa. He had felt that hum for twenty-two years. After today, he would feel it from inside the machine that made it.

His hands remembered before his mind did. The left one ached—it always ached before weather changes, before stress, before anything his body interpreted as threat. Two fingers gone, the stumps long healed but never quiet. He flexed what remained in the darkness and thought about the clamp that had failed, the scream he hadn't heard himself make, the medic who'd told him he was lucky.

Lucky. The Consortium's favorite word for workers who survived.

---

He rose without waking Fatima. Twenty-three years of marriage had taught him how she slept—which movements would pull her up, which would let her drift. He moved like water around stone, gathering his clothes from the chair where he'd laid them the night before, stepping into the narrow hallway where the air was thick and warm.

The apartment was four rooms: bedroom, children's room, a kitchen that doubled as everything else, a bathroom they shared with the Nguyens next door. Standard worker housing, which meant it had been built for six-month occupancy and was now entering its nineteenth year of continuous use. The walls had been painted over so many times that the layers cracked in certain lights, revealing strata of color like geological record. Blue, then green, then yellow, then the current beige that the housing authority called "neutral" and Fatima called "surrender."

He dressed in the kitchen, by the glow of the tether through the window. His good shirt, the one Fatima had pressed last night while he pretended not to notice her crying. His work pants, because he didn't own dress pants, and anyway the security teams would see him as what he was regardless of what he wore. His boots, resoled twice, the leather shaped to his feet after years of holding him upright on platforms that swayed and structures that groaned.

The ticket was in his pocket. He touched it without taking it out—a habit he'd developed over the three months since it arrived. Confirming it was real. Confirming he hadn't dreamed the whole absurd thing.

*Someone sent me a ticket. No note.*

He knew who. The question was why.

---

The water took two minutes to heat, and he used the time to look out the window at the city that had been his prison and his home.

Te Rarawa spread below him in concentric rings of light, each ring dimmer than the last as it moved outward from the tether's base. The Ascension District blazed at the center—corporate towers, luxury hotels, the Grand Terminal where passengers who had paid for their tickets would board through gates of glass and climate-controlled air. The Service Zone surrounded it, dense with the housing blocks and maintenance facilities where workers like him kept the miracle running. And beyond that, the sprawl: informal settlements, protest camps, the desperate and the stubborn and the ones who had come here believing the promises and stayed because they couldn't afford to leave.

He had been all of it. Arrived as a young man full of belief. Worked the high altitudes where the sky turned black and your suit was the only thing between you and a death so fast you wouldn't have time to feel it. Lost friends. Lost fingers. Lost the future he'd been promised. And stayed, because Fatima was here, and then the children were here, and by the time he understood that staying was a form of slow suffocation, he had roots too deep to pull.

The water finally steamed. He made tea—real tea, not the synthetic stuff—because today was not a day for pretending.

---

"Baba?"

He turned. Nadia stood in the doorway to the children's room, her sleep-shirt hanging past her knees, her braids loose and tangled from the pillow. Twelve years old and already she looked at him with eyes that saw too much.

"You should be asleep."

"I couldn't." She padded across the kitchen floor, her bare feet silent on the tile he'd installed himself after the original cracked. "You're really going."

"I'm really going."

"And you're coming back."

It wasn't a question. She was making him say it, making him promise, and he understood why. He had made promises before. Some of them he had kept.

"I'm coming back." He held out his arm and she tucked herself against his side, her head barely reaching his shoulder now though it seemed like yesterday she'd fit entirely in his arms. "Seven days. Maybe eight. I'll bring you something from the Hub."

"I don't want something from the Hub." Her voice was muffled against his shirt. "I want you to see it. I want you to tell me what it's like."

"What what's like?"

"All of it. The inside. The machinery. How they solved the tension problem in the lower atmosphere. Whether the observation deck really has a full three-sixty view or if they had to compromise for structural integrity." She pulled back to look at him, and for a moment he saw himself in her—the hunger for understanding, the need to know how things worked, how they were built, how they held together or fell apart. "I've read everything, Baba. Every technical paper they've released. But reading isn't seeing."

He touched her cheek, the skin smooth and young, unmarked by the sun that had weathered his own face into something like leather. "I'll see it for both of us."

"And then you'll tell me if they got it right."

"I'll tell you everything."

She studied him for a moment longer, and he had the uncomfortable sense that she was cataloging him—memorizing his face the way she memorized schematics and equations. Then she nodded, a quick decisive motion that was pure Fatima.

"Okay." She stepped back. "I'm going to wake Omar. He'll cry if he doesn't get to say goodbye."

She was gone before he could answer, leaving him alone in the kitchen with his tea and the pulsing light of the tether and the weight of a promise he intended to keep.

---

Fatima was awake when he returned to the bedroom. She sat on the edge of the mattress, her nursing scrubs already on—she had the morning shift at the clinic, same as always—her hands folded in her lap in a way that meant she was holding herself together by force of will.

"The children?"

"Nadia's waking Omar." He sat beside her, close enough to feel the warmth of her body but not quite touching. This was how they'd been for weeks, orbiting each other without contact, unable to bridge the distance that the ticket had opened between them.

"You don't have to go." She said it quietly, looking at the wall. "You know that. You could tear it up, stay here, and we could just—"

"I have to go."

"Why?"

He had answered this question a hundred times, in a hundred ways, and none of them had been enough. Because he built it. Because he was promised. Because Kenji Murakami sent him a ticket without a note and he needed to know why. Because twenty years of rage was eating him from the inside and maybe standing in the thing he'd made with his own hands would give him something other than anger to hold onto.

But those weren't the real answers. The real answer was simpler and worse.

"Because if I don't, I'll spend the rest of my life watching it go up without me." He finally turned to look at her, at the face he'd loved since he was twenty-five years old, the face that had aged alongside his own, that had held steady through every loss and every fury and every night when he'd come home silent and shaking from work that was killing him by degrees. "I'll spend the rest of my life being the man who built heaven and couldn't even step inside."

Fatima closed her eyes. A tear slipped down her cheek, and she let it fall.

"Then go." Her voice was steady now, the way it always was when she'd made her peace with something inevitable. "Go and see it and come back. Come back, Yusuf. That's all I ask."

"I will."

"Promise me."

"I promise."

She turned and kissed him—properly, fully, the way they hadn't kissed in weeks—and when she pulled back her eyes were dry and her jaw was set and she was, once again, the woman he had married: strong enough to let him go, strong enough to be there when he returned.

"The children are waiting," she said. "Don't make them cry more than they have to."

---

Omar cried anyway. He was nine years old and didn't understand why his father had to leave, only that he was leaving, and that the tether outside their window was somehow responsible. He clung to Yusuf's legs in the kitchen while Nadia watched with the solemn patience of an older sibling who had already processed her grief and was now waiting for the younger one to catch up.

"I'll be back before you know it." Yusuf knelt to meet his son's eyes, wiping the tears from cheeks that still had the softness of childhood. "And I'll bring you something. A drawing of the stars from up there. What do you think?"

"I can draw stars here."

"Not like these. These will be different. Clearer. Closer."

"How do you know?"

"Because I helped build the windows they'll be looking through." He tapped Omar's nose. "The best windows. The ones without any distortion at all. Your Baba made sure of that."

Omar sniffled, considering this. "Will you draw them yourself, or will you get someone else to do it?"

"Myself. I promise."

"Your drawings aren't very good."

Despite everything, Yusuf laughed. "Then I'll practice. Seven days is enough time to get better."

"Maybe." Omar didn't sound convinced, but he loosened his grip on Yusuf's legs. "Okay. But they have to be good drawings. Or I'll know."

"You'll know."

Fatima appeared with his bag—small, practical, containing only what he'd need and nothing more. She handed it to him without ceremony, and he slung it over his shoulder, feeling the familiar weight of minimal possessions. He had spent seven years living out of bags smaller than this one, in quarters tighter than their apartment, breathing recycled air and watching Earth shrink below him. He knew how to carry only what mattered.

The photograph of his family was in the bag's inner pocket. He had taken it last month, when he'd finally told them he was going, when Fatima had insisted they mark the occasion with something they could all hold onto. In it, they were smiling—even Omar, even Fatima, though he could see the tension in her shoulders if he looked closely. They looked like a family that believed in futures. He needed to believe in it too.

"Walk with me to the door?" he asked Fatima.

She did. The children hung back, watching from the kitchen, two small figures framed by the window and the tether and the morning light that was just beginning to edge the sky.

At the door, Fatima took his hand—the left one, the damaged one, the one most people avoided touching. She ran her thumb over the stumps of his missing fingers, a gesture so familiar it had become a language unto itself.

"Come back," she said again.

"I will."

"I'll be here."

He stepped out into the corridor. Behind him, the door closed with a soft click, and he was alone with the hum of the city and the journey ahead.

---

The Workers' Quarter woke in shifts. First the maintenance crews, heading for the tunnels and the service corridors that kept the tether running. Then the transport workers, loading cargo that would ride the elevator while they stayed behind. Then the vendors, the cleaners, the clinic staff, the teachers—all the people whose labor made the miracle possible and whose names would never appear on any plaque or dedication.

Yusuf walked through them like a ghost. He knew these streets, these faces, this rhythm of survival. He had been part of it for two decades. But today he moved through it differently, aware of how the light fell, how the sounds layered, how the tether's hum underlay everything like a bass note in a song everyone had learned to ignore.

A food cart was already operating on the corner of his block, the vendor—Mrs. Okafor, Nigerian, had been here longer than him—frying dough in oil that smelled of home. She looked up as he passed, her eyes taking in the bag on his shoulder, the direction he was walking.

"Haddad." She nodded once. "Today?"

"Today."

"You'll eat first."

It wasn't a question. She was already wrapping two pieces of fried dough in paper, already pressing them into his hands before he could refuse. He tried to pay; she waved him off.

"You built the damned thing," she said. "Least they can do is feed you before you ride it."

"The Consortium didn't make this."

"No." She smiled, and there was something fierce in it. "We did. Go on. And don't let them forget it."

---

The protests began at the second checkpoint.

He heard them before he saw them: voices raised in chant, drums beating a rhythm that felt like a heartbeat, the occasional whistle or horn cutting through. The crowd was maybe three hundred people, gathered in the plaza that marked the boundary between the Service Zone and the outer approach to the Ascension District. Signs waved above their heads—*WE BUILT HEAVEN*, *ACCESS FOR ALL*, *REMEMBER THE 847*—and somewhere in the mass a banner unfurled with the names of the Black Day dead printed in letters small enough to fit all of them.

Security had formed a line between the protesters and the checkpoint, officers in riot gear standing shoulder to shoulder, faces hidden behind visors. They didn't look like people. That was the point.

Yusuf slowed as he approached, his ticket already in his hand. The protesters saw him—saw the bag, the ticket, the direction he was walking—and for a moment the chanting faltered. Some of them knew him. He had marched with them. He had organized with them. He had stood in rooms and argued for better wages, safer conditions, the passage they were all owed.

And now he was walking through their line, toward a gate they could not enter.

An older man stepped forward—Kwesi, Ghanaian, had worked the anchor platform for fifteen years. His eyes were hard, but his voice was soft.

"Brother Yusuf."

"Brother Kwesi."

"You're really going."

"I am."

They looked at each other across a distance that was more than physical. Kwesi had not gotten a ticket. His name was not on the list of fifty. He had been too vocal, too visible, too willing to stand up when standing up had consequences. The Consortium had long memories.

"Then go." Kwesi's hand landed on Yusuf's shoulder, heavy and warm. "Go and see what we built. And when you come back, you tell them. You tell all of them. Every fancy passenger, every executive, every damn journalist they've got up there recording the great triumph of human achievement. You tell them who built it. You tell them what it cost."

"I will."

"You tell them about Amadou." Kwesi's voice cracked slightly. "About Jin. About the Twelve. About all of them."

"I will."

"And if you see that Chairman—" Kwesi stopped, shook his head. "No. That's your business. Whatever's between you and him, that's yours."

Yusuf said nothing. The ticket in his hand felt heavier than it had any right to be.

Kwesi squeezed his shoulder once more, then stepped back. The crowd parted, creating a path, and Yusuf walked through it toward the checkpoint—toward the gate and the guards and the journey he had been owed for nineteen years.

Behind him, the chanting resumed: *We built heaven. We built heaven. We built heaven.*

He did not look back.

---

Security was invasive, thorough, and utterly impersonal.

They scanned his body three times. They swabbed his hands for residue, checked his bag for contraband, ran his identification through databases he probably wasn't supposed to know existed. They looked at his ticket—the genuine article, Consortium-issued, coded for the Workers' Channel—and then looked at him, and he could see them trying to reconcile the document with the man.

A worker. A builder. Missing two fingers on his left hand, scarred and weathered and old before his time.

Going up.

"Purpose of travel?" The guard's voice was flat, procedural.

"I was invited."

"By whom?"

Yusuf thought about lying, but there was no point. The ticket's provenance was surely logged somewhere. "The Chairman's office."

The guard's expression flickered—surprise, quickly suppressed. He consulted something on his display, typed briefly, then nodded.

"Proceed to the Workers' Channel. Boarding in two hours."

"I know the way."

He did. He had walked past this checkpoint a thousand times, watched it from the other side, seen the lucky or the wealthy or the connected pass through while he stood outside with the others who had built the door and were not allowed to open it. Now he was walking through, and the guards were parting for him, and the world on the other side looked exactly the same as it always had.

That was the thing about gates. They didn't change the landscape. They just decided who could see it.

---

The Workers' Channel was a loading dock dressed up with signage. There was no glass atrium here, no living walls or climate control, no holographic displays celebrating the triumph of human ambition. There was concrete, and metal, and the functional architecture of cargo handling, modified just enough to accommodate human bodies instead of shipping containers.

The queue had already formed when he arrived: workers in their best clothes, lottery winners clutching tickets like talismans, a few families saying their goodbyes. Fifty passengers from this channel. Fifty out of five hundred. One-tenth of the maiden voyage reserved for the people who had made it possible.

*A bead offered for a necklace*, Mama Teiti had called it. He remembered the speech. Everyone remembered the speech.

And there she was.

He spotted her near the front of the queue—small, white-haired, wearing a traditional woven mat over her shoulders instead of the worker coveralls most of them had chosen. She stood straight despite her seventy-one years, her head held high, her eyes fixed on the terminal entrance as if she could see through it to the tether beyond.

Mama Teiti Nakibae. The elder. The conscience. The woman who had organized the first memorial for the Black Day dead when the Consortium wanted to bury their names. The woman who had stood before them all and said: *You promised us passage. You gave us a lottery ticket.*

She was here because the Union had demanded it. Because her presence was the one non-negotiable item in the January Accord. Because she carried the weight of the dead, and even the Consortium understood that weight could not be ignored.

Yusuf took his place at the end of the queue. A few people nodded to him—recognition, respect, the silent acknowledgment of shared history. He nodded back. The queue moved forward, one step at a time, and he watched Mama Teiti's back as she moved with it.

She had lost her husband in the Anchor Collapse. Teriki Nakibae, one of the twenty-three. A diver, a builder, an I-Kiribati man whose knowledge of the sea had helped them anchor the tether to a reef they were destroying in the process. He had died forty meters underwater, trapped in a structure that wasn't supposed to fail, and Mama Teiti had buried him in the waters he'd loved and then spent the next twenty years making sure no one forgot.

Yusuf had known Teriki. Not well—they had worked different sections, different schedules—but well enough to recognize his laugh, to share a meal in the common mess, to understand that he was one of the good ones. There had been so many good ones. So many names on the Shadow Memorial now, carved into concrete by hands that refused to let them be erased.

The queue moved forward. Mama Teiti passed through a security checkpoint—a different one than he'd used, but with the same invasive procedures, the same impersonal efficiency. She emerged on the other side and continued walking, and as she walked she passed a window that offered a view of the tether's base: carbon and steel and the accumulated labor of millions of hands, rising from the platform like a blade of light.

She paused. Just for a moment. Her hand came up and pressed flat against the glass, as if she could feel the structure through it, as if she could feel the dead.

Then she continued walking, and she was gone from his sight.

---

The queue moved faster as it approached the final checkpoint. Yusuf shuffled forward with the others, his ticket in his hand, his bag on his shoulder, his thoughts circling the same questions they had circled for three months.

Why had Kenji sent the ticket?

Guilt, obviously. Nineteen years of silence, and then this—an invitation, or an apology, or something he couldn't define. They had spent four hours together in that emergency compartment, waiting for rescue, and Yusuf had told him everything: the shortcuts, the failures, the bodies. Kenji had listened. Kenji had promised to fix it.

And then Kenji had risen through the Consortium like a man climbing a ladder, and the ladder had rungs made of compromises, and by the time he reached the top he was the thing Yusuf had asked him to fight.

The ticket was not forgiveness. Yusuf was not offering forgiveness, and Kenji—if he had any honesty left—was not asking for it. The ticket was something else. A reckoning, maybe. A chance to stand face to face in the structure they had both helped build, one with his hands and one with his silence, and ask the question that had no good answer:

*What do you owe when everything you've done isn't enough?*

He didn't know. He wasn't sure Kenji knew either.

But he was going to find out.

---

The final checkpoint. The terminal doors. The threshold.

He handed his ticket to the last guard, submitted to the last scan, answered the last questions. The guard looked at him with an expression Yusuf couldn't read—curiosity, maybe, or the faint discomfort of someone confronted with a category they hadn't been trained to process.

"Welcome to the maiden voyage," the guard said, and the words sounded rehearsed, automatic.

"Thank you."

He stepped through.

The terminal opened before him: high ceilings, polished floors, the cathedral scale of a space designed to make passengers feel small and important at the same time. Through the windows, the tether rose impossibly into the sky, its surface catching the morning light, its running lights still pulsing even though the sun was up now, red and white, red and white.

Yusuf stopped just inside the doors. He let his eyes trace the line of the tether upward, following it until it vanished into the blue. Forty-seven kilometers of that structure had passed through his hands. He knew the bolt patterns, the weld specifications, the precise tolerances that kept it stable against wind and weather and the constant stress of holding a thread between Earth and heaven.

He had built this. Him and Teriki and Amadou and Jin and Kwesi and thousands of others whose names would never appear on any dedication plaque, whose labor had been purchased and consumed and forgotten. They had hung in the void and bolted the future together, piece by piece, and now he was finally going to see where it led.

Ahead, he could see the queue continuing through the terminal—workers filing toward the boarding gates, officials directing traffic, the first glimpses of the climber itself visible through the far windows. And there, near the front, Mama Teiti walked with her head held high and her hand pressing the bag at her side, where he knew she carried the photograph of her husband and the stone from the beach that no longer existed.

They were both carrying ghosts. They were both walking into the machine that had consumed what they loved.

Maybe that was why they were here. Not for vindication. Not for justice. Just for witness. Just to stand inside the miracle and remember what it had cost.

Yusuf shifted his bag on his shoulder and began to walk.

Behind him, through the terminal walls, he could still hear the chanting—faint now, almost lost in the hum of the tether, but present. *We built heaven. We built heaven. We built heaven.*

The tower rose before him, bright and terrible.

He walked toward it.
