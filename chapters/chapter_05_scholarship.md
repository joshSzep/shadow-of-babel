# Chapter 5: Scholarship

The smile was starting to hurt.

Zara held it anyway, the same one she'd practiced in her bathroom mirror at the hotel last night, the same one she'd worn for the press pool at breakfast, the same one that would appear in promotional materials for the next decade. *Diverse young scholar, reaching for the stars.* The brochure practically wrote itself.

"Closer together, please. Mei-Lin, can you move to your left? James, chin up. Perfect."

The photographer—third one today—crouched and rose and crouched again, his camera clicking in bursts that sounded like small-arms fire. Behind him, three PR handlers monitored tablets, checking angles, reviewing shots in real-time, whispering into earpieces about lighting and composition and whether Fatou's hijab was catching the reflection off the terminal's glass walls.

Twelve scholarship students arranged on risers, the tether rising behind them like a blessing from a god none of them had asked to meet.

Zara kept smiling.

*The physics of performativity,* she thought. *Force applied over time. Stress distribution across facial muscles. The tensile strength of pretending.*

"Beautiful. Just a few more."

---

The Stellar Foundation staging area occupied a corner of the mid-tier terminal, partitioned from the main flow by frosted glass panels that let in light but obscured the queues beyond. Through the translucent barriers, Zara could see shapes moving—passengers in their hundreds, maybe thousands, processing through checkpoints she would never have to navigate. The scholarship students had their own channel. Their own handlers. Their own carefully curated experience of departure.

She'd been in spaces like this before. The private sixth form in Surrey, where she'd arrived on scholarship at sixteen, speaking differently than her classmates, eating differently, knowing that her presence was both earned and instrumental. The Imperial College reception where industry sponsors had circulated among the physics students, assessing who was photogenic enough to feature in their diversity reports. The conference in Geneva where a Stellar Industries executive had approached her after her presentation on oscillation dampening and said, with the particular warmth of someone who has just identified a useful asset: *We should talk about your future.*

Her future. As if it belonged to them.

"Okay, let's take a break. Ten minutes, everyone. Stay in the area."

The formation dissolved. Students scattered toward the refreshment table, the bathroom, the narrow windows that offered glimpses of the tether's base. Zara stayed where she was, letting the others move around her, cataloging the room with the quick attention she couldn't turn off.

Mei-Lin Wong was already on her tablet, probably reviewing equations, her face carrying the serene intensity of someone who'd never had to perform being smart because she simply was. James Peterson had found his parents—here in person, of course, because MIT aerospace legacies could afford last-minute flights to the Pacific—and was accepting their embraces with the casual confidence of someone for whom this was the natural order of things. Fatou Mbaye sat alone by the window, twenty years old and looking younger, her hands clasped tight in her lap as she stared at the tether with an expression Zara recognized.

*Overwhelmed. Trying not to show it.*

Zara walked over and sat beside her.

"First time seeing it in person?"

Fatou startled, then nodded. Her English was careful, accented with Wolof rhythms. "The photographs don't... they can't..."

"Yeah." Zara looked at the tether—really looked, letting herself see it as a physicist rather than a prop. It rose from the terminal's dome in a line so clean it hurt, silver-white against the morning sky, running lights still pulsing in the fading darkness above. She knew the numbers: 36,000 kilometers to geostationary orbit, composite ribbon averaging 2.3 meters wide, tension loads distributed across carbon nanotube lattices that she'd spent eight months modeling on her laptop in the cramped flat in Hackney where her parents still lived.

And now it was real. Right there. The math made material.

"I used to dream about it," Fatou said quietly. "In Dakar, looking at the stars. My mother said I would never see them closer. That girls like us—" She stopped, shook her head. "And now."

"And now you're about to climb it."

"We're about to climb it." Fatou smiled, small and uncertain. "Do you think we deserve to?"

The question landed harder than Zara expected. She'd asked herself the same thing a hundred times since the acceptance letter arrived. *Do I deserve this? Did I earn it, or was I selected?* The scholarship was merit-based—her grades, her research, her presentation at Geneva—but it was also something else. Twelve students from around the world, carefully distributed across continents and demographics, photographed in configurations designed to communicate that the future was open to everyone.

Which it wasn't. Obviously.

"I think," Zara said carefully, "that deserving has nothing to do with it. Some people bought their tickets. Some people won a lottery. Some people worked their whole lives building this thing and still can't ride it." She nodded toward the frosted glass, toward the shapes moving beyond. "We're here because someone decided we were useful. The question is what we do with it."

Fatou considered this. "In Senegal, we say: *Ku am nit, am na dara.* Who has people, has something. Maybe being useful is how we get to have people. Connections. Doors."

"Maybe." Zara's tablet buzzed in her pocket. She ignored it. "Or maybe being useful is how they keep us from asking why the doors were closed in the first place."

Before Fatou could answer, a handler appeared—a young man with an earpiece and the particular blankness of someone trained to manage complications. "Ms. Chen-Okafor? Your family is on the line. We've set up a private call station."

Zara stood, squeezing Fatou's shoulder briefly. "See you at boarding."

"God willing."

"Physics willing, anyway."

Fatou laughed, startled and genuine. Zara held onto that sound as she followed the handler through the partitioned space, past the refreshment table where Carlos Mendez was explaining something to Priya Venkatesh with animated hands, past the corner where Emma Lindqvist sat alone reviewing what looked like technical schematics, past the bank of screens showing live feeds of the terminal below.

She saw workers in yellow vests. She saw lottery winners clutching tickets. She saw a line of passengers in traditional dress from somewhere she couldn't identify, processing through security with the patient resignation of people accustomed to being processed.

And then she was in the call station—a small booth with soundproofing and a mounted screen—and her mother's face appeared, and everything else fell away.

---

"*Ah, there's my girl!*"

Lily Chen-Okafor's face filled the screen, slightly pixelated by the connection but unmistakably her: the quick smile, the worry lines she blamed on the restaurant, the jade pendant she'd worn every day since Zara's grandmother passed. Behind her, the familiar chaos of the family flat—morning light through the kitchen window, the sound of Marcus shouting something from another room, the smell of congee that Zara could almost taste through the screen.

"Hi, Mum."

"*Let me look at you. Are you eating? You look thin. They're feeding you, yes?*"

"Mum, I've been here two days. I haven't had time to get thin."

"*You got thin at university. I sent care packages, you never ate them—*"

"I ate them! Marcus ate half of them, but I ate them."

"*Speaking of—MARCUS! Come here, your sister is calling!*"

Shuffling, thumping, and then Marcus's face appeared beside their mother's, crowding the screen. Sixteen years old, shooting up faster than his clothes could keep pace with, wearing the same skeptical expression he'd had since he was eight and decided that his big sister's accomplishments were slightly less impressive than she thought they were.

"You're not in space yet," he said. "Why are you calling?"

"I love you too."

"I'm just saying. Call when you're actually *there*. Show me the observation deck. Show me the counterweight mechanism. Did you know they had to redesign the damping system three times because—"

"*Marcus, let your sister talk.*"

"I'm talking! I'm asking scientific questions!"

"I'll send you video," Zara said, smiling despite herself. "Every day. I'll document the whole ascent."

Marcus's expression shifted—just slightly, the mask of teenage indifference cracking to reveal the kid underneath. "Yeah? You promise?"

"I promise."

"Even the engineering sections? The parts they don't show tourists?"

"Especially those. If I can get access."

"*You'll be careful,*" Lily said. It wasn't a question. "*You'll eat properly, you'll sleep, you won't—*"

"Mum."

"*I know, I know, you're a grown woman, you're a scientist, you don't need your mother telling you—*"

"No, I—" Zara stopped, feeling the words tangle in her throat. The call station was small and bright and very far from London. The tether rose outside, waiting, and in a few hours she would be climbing it, leaving the planet for the first time in her life, leaving the atmosphere that had contained every moment of her existence until now. And her mother was worried about whether she was eating.

"I'll be careful," Zara said. "I'll eat. I'll call whenever I can. And when I come back—"

"*When you come back, you'll eat a proper meal at home. Congee and yu choy and those dumplings you like. Your father is already planning.*"

"Where is Dad?"

"*Work. He wanted to be here but they called him in early. He said—*" Lily's voice caught. "*He said to tell you he's proud. That we're both proud. That you're going to do things we never imagined.*"

Zara blinked hard, willing the burning in her eyes to stop. "Mum."

"*Go. Go see the stars. And come back and tell us what they look like.*"

"I will."

"Bring me back something," Marcus said. "Something from orbit. Not like a tourist shop thing, something real."

"I'll try."

"*We love you, Zara.*"

"I love you too."

The screen went dark. Zara sat in the call station for a long moment, breathing, letting the silence settle. Through the soundproofed walls, she could hear the muffled sounds of the staging area—voices, movement, the endless choreography of departure.

Her parents ran a restaurant in Hackney. Her father loaded cargo for a transport company when the restaurant was slow. They had never been on an airplane until Zara's scholarship interview in Geneva, and even then they'd stayed home, unable to afford the trip, watching her presentation via livestream in the kitchen where she'd done her homework every night for eighteen years.

And now their daughter was about to ride a carbon nanotube ribbon to geostationary orbit.

*The physics of improbability,* Zara thought. *The mathematics of who gets to climb and why.*

She wiped her eyes, stood, and walked back into the staging area.

---

The photo session had resumed by the time she returned, but the configuration was different now. No risers, no arranged formation—this was candid, or performed candid, the photographers circulating while the students did things that would look spontaneous in the final images. Reviewing tablets. Gazing pensively at the tether. Engaging in animated conversations about the future of space exploration.

Zara found her assigned mark and performed pensiveness for a few minutes, watching the tether through the window while cameras clicked.

*36,000 kilometers,* she thought. *Ascent rate approximately 200 kilometers per hour, variable with load and atmospheric conditions. Seven days to reach geostationary orbit. The longest journey any of us will ever take, measured in time if not distance.*

She'd written her thesis proposal on the oscillation dampening problem—the way the tether's natural frequencies interacted with atmospheric turbulence in the lower reaches, creating resonance patterns that had plagued early designs. The Chen-Okafor paper, they called it now, though Dr. Okafor at Imperial had contributed the theoretical framework while she'd done the computational modeling. Her work. Her math. Her tiny contribution to the structure rising before her.

And here she was, about to ride it, because someone had decided that contribution made her valuable.

"Ms. Chen-Okafor." A different handler this time, older, with the crisp efficiency of seniority. "Mr. Lindqvist would like to meet the scholarship cohort before boarding. If you could gather with the others?"

*Mr. Lindqvist.* Henrik Lindqvist, CEO of Lindqvist Orbital Industries, major donor to the Stellar Foundation, one of the faces of private space enterprise. Zara had read about him—everyone had read about him—the Swedish industrialist who'd inherited an aerospace fortune and multiplied it in orbit. His company held seventeen percent of the elevator's cargo contracts. His family's name was on the scholarship that had brought her here.

"Of course," she said, and let herself be guided.

---

He was taller than she'd expected. Silver-blond hair, blue eyes, a suit that probably cost more than her parents' flat. The smile reached his eyes—or appeared to—and he worked the line of students with the practiced ease of someone who'd done this a thousand times.

Zara watched him approach, shaking hands, asking questions, performing interest with a fluency that could have been genuine or could have been training so thorough it had become indistinguishable from genuine. James Peterson lit up when Lindqvist reached him—of course he did, their families probably knew each other—and the conversation lingered there longer than elsewhere.

Then he was in front of her.

"Ms. Chen-Okafor." He shook her hand, his grip firm and brief. "The Chen-Okafor paper on oscillation dampening. Impressive work for a graduate student."

She felt herself recalibrate, surprised that he knew. Or that he'd been briefed to know. Did it matter which?

"Thank you, Mr. Lindqvist. The scholarship made it possible."

"That's what it's for." The smile again, warm and smooth. "Making the impossible possible. That's what all of this is about."

She heard the words as he intended them: inspiring, generous, a vision of meritocracy in action. She also heard them differently: *We paid for you. You're proof that the system works. Smile for the camera.*

Both were true. That was what made it complicated.

"The elevator's dampening systems use a variant of your proposed algorithm," Lindqvist continued. "Did you know that? The engineering team adapted your models for the lower-atmosphere transition zone."

She hadn't known. Or rather, she'd suspected—the timing of the implementation matched her publication date—but no one had confirmed it. The realization landed strangely: pride and unease mixed together, the knowledge that her work was *in there*, woven into the structure she was about to climb, and also that no one had thought to tell her until now.

"I'm glad it was useful," she said, because that was what you said.

"More than useful. Essential." Lindqvist's eyes held hers a moment longer than necessary, and she saw something there—calculation, assessment, the particular attention of someone deciding whether an asset was performing to spec. "The future needs people like you, Ms. Chen-Okafor. People who see problems and solve them. I hope the voyage gives you everything you're looking for."

"Thank you," she said. "I hope so too."

He moved on. David Osei was next, then Ana Lucia, then the others, each receiving their moment of recognition, their confirmation that they'd been seen, that they mattered, that they belonged here.

Zara watched him work the line and felt the familiar tension settle in her chest: gratitude and resentment, opportunity and obligation, the weight of being exactly what they wanted her to be.

*The physics of complicity,* she thought. *The mathematics of having no other door.*

---

The boarding announcement came at 09:47 local time.

Zara heard it first through the staging area's speakers, then through the handlers' earpieces as they began organizing movement. The scholarship students would board through the Distinguished Guest channel—not VIP, not quite, but above the standard and economy tiers that held the lottery winners and workers. Middle passage. The tier of the useful.

"Single file, please. Stay with your cohort. Credentials ready."

They moved through the terminal in a cluster, cameras still clicking around them, handlers guiding them past the public queues with the particular efficiency of people who knew how to make separation look natural. Zara glimpsed the other channels as they walked: the economy line snaking through a distant corridor, the workers' gate somewhere she couldn't see, the VIP entrance where Henrik Lindqvist had presumably already passed.

The terminal was vast—cathedral scale, the design documents had called it, though Zara had never been in a cathedral that hummed with this particular vibration, the deep thrum of the tether's anchor resonating through every surface. The architecture soared overhead, glass and carbon composite, living walls breathing recycled air that smelled faintly of ozone and possibility.

And at the center, visible through reinforced windows, the climber waited.

Zara stopped.

She knew the specifications. Two hundred meters tall, forty meters wide at maximum diameter. Fifteen thousand tonnes of passenger vessel, designed for a week-long ascent through atmosphere and vacuum. She'd modeled its structural stresses, calculated its resonance frequencies, written forty-three pages on how to keep it from shaking apart in the transition zone.

But the numbers weren't this.

The climber rose from its docking cradle like a temple given permission to move, silver-white in the morning light, running lights tracing its length in slow pulses. Windows studded its curved hull—observation ports that would show Earth shrinking and stars emerging and the black of space pressing in from all sides. At its base, the grip mechanism embraced the tether with a precision she'd only imagined, the interface between vessel and ribbon that would carry them upward for seven days.

It was beautiful. Genuinely, terrifyingly beautiful.

"Ms. Chen-Okafor?" A handler's voice, patient. "The line is moving."

She walked. Her legs carried her toward the boarding gate, past the security checkpoints that scanned her credentials without hesitation, through the final corridor that connected terminal to vessel. The threshold was marked by a subtle shift—flooring, lighting, the quality of air itself—and then she was inside, and the climber's hum wrapped around her like a promise she hadn't asked for.

Level 5, Cabin 533. Her assigned berth. She followed the wayfinding markers through corridors that curved in ways her spatial reasoning struggled to map, past other passengers finding their own places, past crew members in pressed uniforms offering directions with practiced smiles.

The cabin was small—designed for two, she'd share with Mei-Lin—but it had a window. A single observation port, currently showing the terminal below, the tether's base stretching out of sight, the city beyond in its concentric rings of light and shadow.

She stood at the window and let herself feel it.

*I'm here,* she thought. *After all of it—the exams, the papers, the interviews, the performances—I'm actually here. About to ride my own equations into space.*

Her tablet buzzed. A message from Marcus: *You on board yet? Send pics.*

She took a photo of the window, the terminal, the impossible tether rising beyond, and sent it without comment.

His response came immediately: *SICK. Now show me the structural framework.*

She laughed—a real laugh, unexpected—and typed back: *Later. Just boarded. Let me breathe.*

*Breathing is overrated. Engineering is forever.*

*You're sixteen. You don't get to be profound yet.*

*I get to be whatever I want. I'm not the one riding a giant carbon ribbon into space.*

*Fair point.*

She put the tablet away and turned back to the window.

The terminal below was still busy—passengers flowing, handlers directing, the machinery of departure grinding through its final cycles. Somewhere down there, lottery winners were clutching tickets and praying they were real. Somewhere down there, workers were processing through their own channel, the people who'd built this thing and been promised passage and now, finally, might receive it. Somewhere down there, the queues stretched and the wait continued and the vast majority of humanity remained exactly where they'd always been: on the ground, looking up.

And here was Zara, above them. Because someone had decided her math was good enough. Because she'd smiled at the right cameras and said the right things and accepted the scholarship that came with strings she was still learning to see.

*The physics of ascent,* she thought. *The mathematics of exception.*

She didn't know yet what she would do with this—the access, the platform, the elevated view. She didn't know if she could change anything from inside or if the inside would change her first. She didn't know what Fatou's question really meant, whether deserving had any relationship to having, whether the doors she'd walked through would stay open for the ones behind her.

But she was here. In the climber. About to ride the longest structure in human history into a future she couldn't predict.

A soft chime sounded through the cabin—the preliminary departure announcement, welcoming passengers aboard.

Zara pressed her palm against the window, feeling the cool glass, the subtle vibration of systems preparing to climb.

Below, the world she knew spread out in rings of light and shadow.

Above, the tether rose toward stars she'd dreamed of since she was Marcus's age, lying on the roof of the Hackney flat, imagining what it would feel like to touch them.

*Now I'll find out,* she thought. *For better or worse. Now I'll find out.*

The climber hummed around her, patient and vast.

Zara took a breath, and waited to rise.
