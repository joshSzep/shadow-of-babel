# Chapter 22: Yusuf's Memory

The bunk was too narrow, and the ceiling was too close, and his left hand wouldn't stop aching.

Yusuf lay in the dark, listening to the breathing of three strangers. The man below him wheezed on every exhale—allergies, or a cold, or something the medical screening should have caught. Across the cabin, someone muttered in Tagalog, the words surfacing from dreams and sinking back. The third passenger was silent, which somehow made it worse. Yusuf kept waiting for a sound that didn't come.

The climber hummed around them. That constant pulse, the electromagnetic drive gripping the tether and pulling, pulling, pulling. He knew the frequency. Knew it the way you knew a heartbeat after years of listening to it through a stethoscope, or through a chest pressed against yours in the dark. The frequency had changed since the early days—the drive systems were smoother now, the harmonics tuned to minimize structural fatigue. But underneath the polish, the rhythm was the same.

He had built this rhythm. Had hung in the void while the first drive modules were installed, had felt the vibration through his suit when the engineers ran the initial tests. *Like a baby's heartbeat*, Achille had said. *Strong. Steady. Ready to be born.*

Yusuf closed his eyes, but the memory was already there—had been waiting, as it always waited, for the moment when exhaustion lowered his defenses and let the past walk in.

March 2059. Altitude: 5,200 kilometers.

The tether was thin here—not the robust ribbon it would become in the Thickening phase, but a thread, a promise, a blade of carbon that seemed too delicate to hold the weight of everything they were building. Yusuf moved along it hand over hand, his safety line trailing behind him like an umbilical cord, his suit's headlamp cutting a cone of light through the absolute dark. His gloves were too thick—they were always too thick—and he had to concentrate on each grip, each release, the rhythm of movement that kept you alive out here.

Achille was ahead of him, maybe twenty meters, his own lamp a small sun against the void. They were doing splice inspection—the tedious, essential work of checking every junction where ribbon sections had been bonded together. The splices were the weak points, the places where stress concentrated, where a flaw invisible to the naked eye could become a fracture, a failure, a catastrophe. Twelve hours of crawling along the tether, checking readings, flagging anomalies. Then twelve hours of rest in the station below, then twelve more hours of crawling. The shifts blurred into each other. Time became meaningless up here, where day and night were arbitrary, where Earth was a marble and the stars were knives.

"Haddad." Achille's voice crackled through the comm. "I've got something."

Yusuf pulled himself forward, feeling the slight flex of the tether beneath his gloves. His fingers were already stiff from the cold—the suit's heating never quite reached the extremities—and he had to will them to grip, release, grip again. The material was warm on the sun-facing side, cold on the shadow side—temperature differential that the engineers were still learning to model. He reached Achille's position and looked where the Cameroonian was pointing.

A splice junction. The bonding looked clean to the eye, but the handheld scanner was showing a reading that shouldn't exist: micro-fractures in the substrate, spreading like frost across glass. The kind of flaw that could hold for years, or could fail in the next hour.

"Flag it," Yusuf said. "Mark it red. They'll need to reinforce."

"Already flagged." Achille's voice was tight. He had seen this before—they both had. The question wasn't whether the flaw existed. The question was whether anyone would do something about it. The schedules were tight. The investors were watching. Every delay cost money, and the people making decisions about money were very far away, in offices with gravity and air and windows that looked out on something other than the infinite dark.

"They'll fix it," Achille said. It was something he said often. A prayer, or a lie, or both.

Yusuf didn't answer. He was looking past Achille, toward the next stretch of tether, where the inspection stations were spaced at hundred-meter intervals. Twelve hours of this. Then twelve hours of fitful sleep. Then twelve more hours.

"You know what I miss?" Achille asked. His voice had shifted—lighter now, the tone he used when the work was done and the waiting had begun. "Rain. Real rain, not the recycled mist in the station showers. I want to stand outside and feel it hit my face. Feel it run down my neck." He laughed softly. "My daughter has never seen rain. Can you believe that? Eight years old, born in Te Rarawa, and she's never seen rain. The city has weather, they say. Controlled humidity. Scheduled precipitation events. But it's not the same."

"It's not the same," Yusuf agreed.

"When we finish this—when the passage opens—I'm taking her to Douala. To my mother's house. We'll sit on the porch in September and watch the storms come in from the sea." Achille's lamp turned toward Yusuf, the light harsh and bright. "What about you? What will you do, when you can finally ride this thing instead of building it?"

Yusuf thought about it. The honest answer was that he couldn't imagine it—couldn't imagine being a passenger, sitting in climate-controlled comfort while the tether rose beneath him. The thought felt wrong, like wearing someone else's clothes. He was a builder. He belonged out here, in the cold and the dark, with his hands on the structure.

"I'll bring my children," he said finally. "Show them the stars from the top. Show them what their father made."

"Good answer." Achille turned back to his work, his lamp sweeping across the next section of tether. "Good answer, brother."

---

The debris came without warning.

That was the thing about space. There was no sound, no shadow, no sense of something approaching. One moment you were moving through the void, your suit readings normal, your tether secure. The next moment, the universe shifted.

Yusuf felt it before he saw it. A vibration through the tether—wrong, sharp, the kind of frequency that meant structural compromise. He looked up, and in the same instant, his headlamp caught the spray of particles: aluminum, maybe, or carbon composite, shrapnel from some ancient satellite that had finally decayed into the crossing point of their orbit.

The impact was silent. A flash of light, a sparkle of debris, and then—

Achille's lamp went dark.

"Mbeki." Yusuf's voice was flat, controlled. Training. You didn't survive in vacuum by panicking. "Mbeki, respond."

Static.

He pulled himself forward, hand over hand, faster than protocol allowed. The tether was vibrating beneath him—aftershocks from the impact, stress propagating through the structure. He reached the point where Achille had been.

The tether was intact. The splice they had flagged was still there, its fractures spreading slowly through the substrate. But Achille's safety line was severed. Cut clean, the composite fibers bright and raw at the edge.

Yusuf looked up. Looked out. Into the void.

He saw Achille's suit. Tumbling, slowly, already a hundred meters out and drifting farther. The headlamp was dark, but the suit's emergency beacon was blinking—red, red, red—a heartbeat of light against the infinite black.

"Mbeki!" Yusuf was moving before he knew what he was doing, unhooking his own line, preparing to push off—

"Haddad, negative." The voice in his comm was sharp, authoritative. Station control. "Do not detach. Repeat, do not detach. Rescue protocols are—"

"He's drifting. If I don't—"

"Haddad, your thruster pack is rated for forty meters of maneuvering. He's already past a hundred. If you detach, we lose both of you."

Yusuf's hands were on the tether, his body leaning toward the void. He could see the beacon, still blinking. Still blinking. Achille was alive in there. His suit was intact. If Yusuf could reach him—

"Haddad." A different voice now. Softer. The station medic, maybe, or one of the supervisors trained in these moments. "His velocity is four meters per second and increasing. Even if you reached him, you couldn't arrest his momentum. You'd both drift until your air ran out."

The beacon was smaller now. A point of light, like a star. Like the million other stars around it, indifferent and cold.

"We're scrambling a retrieval shuttle," the voice continued. "Hold your position. That's an order."

Yusuf held his position.

He watched the beacon drift.

He watched it become a point.

He watched it disappear.

---

The shuttle found the body forty-seven hours later.

By then, Yusuf was back in the station, sitting in the common area with a cup of synthetic coffee going cold in his hands. He hadn't slept. Couldn't sleep. Every time he closed his eyes, he saw the beacon blinking. Red, red, red.

They brought Achille in through the cargo bay—standard procedure for casualties, the main airlock reserved for the living. Yusuf wasn't supposed to be there, but no one stopped him when he walked through the corridors, when he stood at the edge of the bay, when he watched them unseal the body bag.

The suit was intact. The suit was always intact. Space didn't care about the body inside it. Space just waited.

Achille's face was peaceful. That was the wrong word, probably—there was no expression at all, the cold having done its work—but Yusuf thought of it as peaceful. Eyes closed. Lips slightly parted, as if he'd been about to say something. The frost on his lashes caught the light.

*My daughter has never seen rain.*

The medical officer—a young woman from Singapore, her face carefully professional—placed a hand on Yusuf's shoulder.

"You should go," she said. "There's nothing more to see here."

There was nothing more to see. That was true. Achille was a body now, a number, a casualty statistic that would be filed and processed and eventually forgotten. In a few hours, the cargo shuttle would take him down to Te Rarawa, and in a few days, his family would receive him, and in a few weeks, the Consortium would send a representative to explain how deeply sorry they were for the unforeseen debris event that had claimed such a valued member of the team.

Unforeseen. As if orbital debris was a surprise. As if they hadn't cut the budget for debris-tracking when the cost projections came in too high.

Yusuf looked at Achille's face one last time.

"I'll tell her about the rain," he said. He didn't know if the words were audible, if anyone heard them, if they meant anything at all. "I'll tell her about her father."

He walked out of the cargo bay and didn't look back.

---

The report came down three weeks later.

*Worker: Mbeki, Achille Kwame. ID: 558-772-349-A.*
*Incident: Micrometeorite impact resulting in tether detachment.*

Micrometeorite. Yusuf had seen the shrapnel—aluminum fragments, carbon composite. Satellite debris, not rock. But *micrometeorite* sounded natural. Unavoidable. No one's fault.

*Cause of death: Asphyxiation following suit oxygen depletion.*
*Finding: No procedural violation identified. Safety protocols were followed. Event classified as unforeseen debris strike.*
*Recommendation: Continued monitoring of orbital debris trajectories. Enhanced shielding for high-risk tether sections (pending budget review).*
*Compensation: Standard survivor benefit paid to designated beneficiaries. Case closed.*

Yusuf read the report in the station's administrative office, standing at a terminal because there were no chairs, because the office was designed for efficiency rather than comfort, because the people who built it didn't expect anyone to linger.

*No procedural violation identified.*

The splice they had flagged—the micro-fractures spreading through the substrate—had not been mentioned. The debris-tracking cuts had not been mentioned. The shuttle response time—forty-seven hours, when the rescue protocols promised six—had not been mentioned.

*Event classified as unforeseen debris strike.*

*Case closed.*

Yusuf stood at the terminal for a long time. His hand was on the console. His left hand, the one that would lose two fingers to a faulty clamp three years later. He could feel the vibration of the station around him. The same vibration he felt in the tether. The heartbeat of the thing they were building.

He thought about Achille's daughter, who would never see rain with her father. He thought about the men who had written this report, who had signed their names to it, who had closed the case and moved on. They were far away, in offices with gravity and air. They had never watched a beacon drift into the dark.

Something changed in Yusuf, standing at that terminal.

He couldn't have named it then. Couldn't have said what it was, what shape it took, what it would become. But he felt it—a hardening, a crystallization, a decision that lived in his bones before it reached his brain.

He would remember.

When they forgot Achille—and they would forget, they always forgot—he would remember.

When they called the deaths unforeseen, when they closed the cases, when they paid the settlements and moved on—he would remember.

And someday, somehow, he would make them see.

---

The bunk was too narrow. The ceiling was too close. The climber hummed around him, that same heartbeat rhythm, and Yusuf lay in the dark with his eyes open and his left hand throbbing where the fingers used to be.

Twenty-six years since Achille drifted into the void. The words had become part of him—not just memory, but structure, the framework that held his anger in place.

*My daughter has never seen rain.*

The daughter was thirty-four now, married, living in Douala. Yusuf had kept his promise—had told her about her father, had described the way Achille moved along the tether, the way his lamp cut through the dark, the way his voice sounded when he talked about September storms. She had wept, and thanked him, and named her first son Achille, and Yusuf had stood at the naming ceremony with his hands at his sides and his grief locked behind his ribs where no one could see it.

He was good at locking things away. Good at surviving. That was what the work had taught him—how to keep moving, how to keep functioning, how to hold the rage at a distance where it couldn't consume him.

But here, in this cabin, in this structure he had built, the distance had collapsed.

She was here.

Miriam Okonkwo. The architect. The woman who had drawn the plans and solved the equations and made the whole impossible thing possible. She must have known what it would cost—must have known about the debris risk, the radiation exposure, the splice junctions that would fail. She had to have known. And she had built it anyway.

And now she was aboard, riding the structure that had killed Achille and a thousand others, and Yusuf was lying in a bunk three decks below her, unable to sleep, unable to forget, unable to stop the question that had been building in him since the ticket arrived.

*Did you see us? When you drew your plans, when you solved your problems—did you see us? Or were we just numbers? Just factors in an equation? Just cost to be managed?*

He didn't know what he wanted from her. Didn't know if he wanted an apology, or an explanation, or simply acknowledgment. That she had seen them. That they had mattered. That their deaths had not been—to her, at least—unforeseen.

Maybe he wanted her to say: *I knew. I knew and I'm sorry. I knew and it's not enough.*

Maybe he wanted her to feel what he felt—the weight of the names, the pressure of the silence, the gravity of a thousand cases closed.

Or maybe—and this was the thought he couldn't quite face—maybe he just wanted to stand in front of her and say Achille's name. To make someone who mattered hear it. To force the architect to look at what she had built, and see the beacon blinking in the void.

*Red, red, red.*

Yusuf sat up in his bunk, moving carefully in the reduced gravity. The ceiling pressed close above him. The other passengers slept, or pretended to sleep, their breathing the only sound beneath the drive's constant hum.

He swung his legs over the edge and dropped to the floor, his bare feet finding the cold composite surface. His knees protested—they always protested now, damaged by years of pressure suit work, by the endless stress of holding positions the human body was never meant to hold. He ignored them. He had been ignoring them for twenty years.

The cabin was dark except for the emergency strips along the floor, the faint glow of the porthole where stars wheeled slowly past. He moved toward the porthole and pressed his palm against the glass, feeling the cold of space bleeding through.

Out there, somewhere, was the section of tether where Achille had died. They had passed it hours ago, or would pass it soon—he had lost track of the altitude readings, lost track of the climb's progress, lost track of everything except the weight in his chest and the name in his mouth.

*Achille Kwame Mbeki. My brother. My friend.*

He would find her tomorrow.

Not tonight—the corridors were monitored at night, and the security teams were watching for exactly this kind of movement, workers who couldn't stay in their assigned areas, workers who wanted to breach the class boundaries that kept the climber orderly. But tomorrow there would be observation hours, mixed events, the managed opportunities for passengers to see each other across the divide.

He would find her at one of those events. Or he would find a way into the upper decks—slip through a service corridor, maybe the J-7 maintenance trunk that ran between the engineering section and the passenger decks. He had helped install the access panels in corridors just like it. He knew where the cameras had gaps.

And when he found her—

What?

He didn't know. Didn't have a plan, a script, a set of demands. He had only the weight, only the names, only the question that wouldn't let him sleep.

*Did you see us?*

He would ask. She would answer, or she wouldn't. And either way, he would have done what Achille could not do, what all the closed cases could not do, what the official narrative tried every day to prevent.

He would make her look.

Yusuf stood at the porthole until the stars blurred and his hand went numb against the glass. Then he returned to his bunk, lay down in the narrow space, and waited for the artificial dawn that would let him begin.

The climber rose through the dark. The tether hummed its steady rhythm. And somewhere in the structure above him, the woman who had built this miracle slept in quarters that cost more than Achille's entire settlement.

Tomorrow.

He would find her tomorrow.

And she would hear the name.

*End of Day Three, Night. Altitude: 19,400 kilometers. Days remaining: 4.*
