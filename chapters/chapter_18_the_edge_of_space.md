# Chapter 18: The Edge of Space

The secondary observation alcove on Level 12 was empty at 0547.

Miriam had learned the climber's rhythms in the day and a half since departure—when the observation deck filled, when the corridors cleared, when the scheduled events drew passengers away from the quiet spaces where a woman might stand alone with what she had made. The main deck opened at 0700; the scholarship cohort had their slot at seven; the premium passengers preferred the private lounges after breakfast. This alcove, tucked between a maintenance corridor and a storage bay, drew almost no traffic.

She had found it during her first night aboard, unable to sleep, walking the corridors the way she had once walked construction sites: reading the structure, listening to its sounds, feeling the vibrations through her feet. The alcove was small—room for perhaps four people standing close—with a single curved viewport perhaps two meters wide. Not the grand dome, not the floor-to-ceiling transparency of the VIP lounge. Just a window, set into the hull at an angle that caught the view below and ahead.

She stood there now, her hand on the viewport's frame, watching the sky change.

---

The blue was wrong.

Not wrong—different. Deeper than any blue she had seen from Earth, shading toward indigo at the edges, toward violet where the curve of the atmosphere thinned against the dark. She knew the physics: Rayleigh scattering, the preferential diffusion of shorter wavelengths, the exponential decrease of atmospheric density with altitude. At fifty kilometers—they were approaching fifty kilometers—the scale height of the atmosphere meant that ninety-nine percent of the air was below them. The remaining one percent scattered so little light that the sky began to reveal what lay beyond it.

Stars.

Not the stars of night, not the stars that emerged when the sun set and the sky darkened. These were the stars of day—visible even now, even with the sun blazing somewhere behind the climber's bulk, even with Earth's reflected light filling the viewport. They burned steady and cold against the deepening blue, pinpricks of ancient fire that had always been there, hidden only by the veil of air that humanity had breathed since before it had words for breathing.

Miriam pressed her palm flat against the viewport. The composite was cool, vibrating faintly with the climber's pulse—the electromagnetic drive engaging the tether, the rhythm she had specified in design documents thirty years ago. Two hundred meters per second at this altitude. Increasing as they rose, as the air thinned, as the friction that slowed them became memory.

She had calculated all of this. She had drawn curves of velocity against altitude, plotted the thermal loads, modeled the oscillation dampening that kept the tether stable through the passage of climbers. The numbers were precise, elegant, complete.

The numbers had not prepared her for this.

---

The transition happened slowly, then all at once.

For hours, the sky had been blue—strange blue, deep blue, but recognizably the color of Earth's embrace. The atmosphere had thinned around them in gradual degrees, the pressure outside the hull dropping along predictable curves, the temperature swinging between extremes that the climber's systems managed without comment. She had watched the altimeter on her tablet tick upward: thirty kilometers, forty, forty-five.

And then, somewhere between forty-eight and fifty-two kilometers, the blue began to die.

It started at the zenith—the point directly above them, where the atmosphere was thinnest, where the scattering gave way first. The indigo deepened, darkened, shed its last pretense of color. Black emerged: not the black of closed eyes, not the black of unlit rooms, but the black of nothing. The void. The endless dark that surrounded their small bubble of air and light and held it, patient as death, waiting.

The black spread downward, eating the blue in a slow tide. The horizon held longest—that thin bright line where atmosphere met space, where the scattered light made its last stand. From here, the atmosphere appeared as a luminous band, a ribbon of blue fire curving along Earth's edge. So thin. So impossibly thin. All the air she had ever breathed, everyone had ever breathed, contained in that fragile arc.

Miriam watched the transition and felt something move in her chest—a shifting, a reordering, a change in the way she understood where she was.

She had designed this. She had made this possible. Millions of people would eventually stand where she stood, would watch this same sky darken, would feel this same trembling recognition of what the universe actually looked like when you rose high enough to see it.

She waited to feel triumph, or at least satisfaction. What came instead had no name she knew.

---

The sun was behind them—she could tell by the angle of light on the viewport's edge, by the way Earth's surface gleamed silver and blue below. The climber's rotation and the tether's orientation meant that passengers on this side saw the planet rather than the star. She was grateful. Looking at the sun from here, unfiltered by atmosphere, would be blinding. Looking at Earth was merely heartbreaking.

The planet curved below her like an offering. Clouds swirled in patterns she recognized from satellite imagery, from the weather models she had consulted during anchor site selection, from decades of looking at Earth as a problem to be solved rather than a home to be loved. A storm system sprawled across the western Pacific—she could see the spiral arms, the eye of calm at its center, the shadow it cast on the ocean beneath. Weather. From here, it was just weather. From down there, it was people boarding up windows, stockpiling supplies, praying for the storm to turn.

The scale was wrong. The scale was exactly right. She couldn't decide which.

She thought of Teiti Nakibae, standing at the observation deck the day before, searching the Pacific for something that wasn't there anymore. The reef. The islands. The world that had been erased so that Miriam could stand here now and watch storms from above.

*Did you know?*

The question that would come. The question she had been avoiding since she agreed to board this vessel. Not from journalists, who asked it as performance. From someone who had the right to ask it truly.

*Did you know what would be destroyed?*

She had known. Not the details—not the names of the fish that would die, not the faces of the workers who would drown, not the specific contours of the grief that would follow. But she had known that building on this scale required sacrifice, and she had made her calculations accordingly.

The reef had been a data point. The indigenous communities had been a political obstacle. The environmental assessments had been boxes to check, language to manage, costs to weigh against benefits. She had sat in meetings where the numbers were presented, had voted yes when the votes were called, had moved on to the next problem with the efficiency that had made her career.

*The mathematics were clean. It was only the people that got complicated.*

No. That wasn't true. That was the excuse she had told herself then, the justification that had let her sleep at night. The truth was simpler and worse: she had known, and she had decided that what she was building mattered more than what it would cost. She had weighed the reef against the tower, the fish against the future, the indigenous homeland against humanity's reach for the stars.

She had chosen. The tower existed because she had chosen.

A sound at the alcove's entrance—footsteps, soft, hesitant. Miriam turned.

A young woman stood at the threshold, perhaps twenty-five, with the particular bearing of someone who had spent their life working with their hands. Her coveralls bore the insignia of climber maintenance, but she was off-duty—no tools, no tablet, just a person seeking a quiet place to watch the sky.

"I'm sorry." The woman started to retreat. "I didn't know anyone was—"

"Stay." The word came before Miriam could consider it. "There's room."

The woman hesitated, reading something in Miriam's face—permission, perhaps, or loneliness. Then she stepped forward, finding a position at the viewport's edge, leaving space between them.

For a moment, they stood in silence, watching the transition together. The black had won now; only the horizon still held its ribbon of blue. Stars scattered across the dark—more than Miriam had ever seen, more than she had imagined, a river of ancient light pouring across the void.

"I've seen pictures," the woman said quietly. "Videos. I thought I knew what it would look like."

"Everyone thinks that."

"But it's not—" She stopped, struggling for words. "It's not like looking at something. It's like something looking at you."

Miriam felt the truth of it in her chest. The void didn't care about them—that was the point, that was the terror and the freedom. But standing here, watching the last blue fade, she understood what the woman meant. The universe was not hostile; it was worse than hostile. It was simply there, vast beyond comprehension, indifferent to the small things that crept up from one small world to peer into the dark.

*We don't belong here,* something in her whispered.

*We came anyway,* something else replied.

"You're Dr. Okonkwo."

The words pulled Miriam back from the void. She turned to find the woman watching her—not with hostility, not with awe, but with the particular attention of someone fitting pieces together.

"Yes."

"The structural engineer. The oscillation solution."

"Yes."

The woman was quiet for a moment. Her eyes moved between Miriam's face and the view beyond the glass.

"My father worked the mid-altitude sections," she said. "2067 to 2074. He talked about you sometimes. Said you came to the construction sites—the real sites, not just the observation platforms. Said you listened to the workers."

Miriam remembered. The endless shuttle rides, the pressure suits, the exhaustion. She had insisted on seeing the work herself, on understanding what her calculations meant in terms of cable and clamp and human hands. The other engineers had thought it was eccentricity. She had thought it was responsibility.

"What was his name?"

"Viktor Novak. Czech. He worked the tether bonding crews."

The name surfaced from deep memory—a face, a conversation, a complaint about faulty sealant that had turned out to be a legitimate design flaw. "I remember him. He caught a microfracture in Section 227. Probably prevented a break."

The woman—Viktor's daughter—nodded slowly. "He never talked about that. Just about how you listened. How you actually wrote down what he said." She paused. "He also said the company used you as a shield sometimes. That it was easier to ignore complaints because they could point to you and say, 'Look, she listens.'"

Miriam absorbed that. It was true. She had known it was true even then—had felt herself being positioned, had let it happen because the alternative was losing access entirely. Another compromise. Another weight.

"Did he—is he—"

"He made it home. Retired five years ago. His lungs aren't great—the radiation got to him, despite what the company says—but he's alive."

*He's alive.* Not everyone was. Not anywhere near everyone.

"I'm glad," Miriam said, and meant it.

The silence stretched between them, filled by the humming of the climber's systems, the faint whisper of air circulation, the profound nothing of space pressing against the glass.

Then the woman said: "You made this."

Three words. Not accusation, not praise, not question. Just statement—flat, factual, unavoidable. *You made this.*

Miriam looked at the view: the black sky, the burning stars, the thin bright line of atmosphere clinging to Earth's curve. The tether above them, stretching toward infinity. The climber around them, rising on rails she had specified, through void she had helped humanity reach.

"Yes," she said. "I made this."

She waited for what would come next—the questions, the accusations, the demand for justification. Viktor Novak's daughter had earned the right to ask. Her father had spent seven years in vacuum so that Miriam's calculations could become real. The debt was incalculable.

But the woman only nodded, once, and returned her gaze to the stars.

"I just wanted to know," she said. "That's all. I just wanted to see the person who made what my father helped build."

She didn't elaborate. Miriam didn't ask what she'd seen.

---

They stood together for a long time, watching the edge of space complete its transformation.

The last blue faded. The horizon thinned to a line of fire—atmosphere compressed to its densest layer, scattering the final rays with furious intensity. And then even that began to give way, the blue shifting toward white, the white toward the harsh clarity of unfiltered sun.

They were in space now. Properly, truly, in space. The Kármán line—the arbitrary boundary at one hundred kilometers—still lay above them, but the atmosphere below had become negligible. The void had claimed them.

Miriam felt the weight of it settle onto her shoulders, into her bones. Every breath she took had to be manufactured. Every moment of warmth had to be generated. The universe would kill her in seconds if the climber's systems failed, if the pressure seals ruptured, if the carefully maintained bubble of habitability collapsed. She was alive only by engineering—by calculation and fabrication and the accumulated effort of thousands of people who had built this vessel and the tower it climbed.

*You made this.*

She had. Not alone—never alone—but she had been the one to solve the problem that everyone said was unsolvable. The oscillation issue, they had called it. The resonance cascade that would tear any cable apart before it reached geostationary altitude. She had found the damping solution, had modeled the harmonics, had turned impossible mathematics into possible structure.

For thirty years, she had called that her greatest achievement.

Standing here, watching the stars burn steady in the eternal dark, she wasn't sure anymore what achievement meant. The tower existed. People rode it toward the future. But 1,247 people had died to build it, and a reef had been erased to anchor it, and the workers who had assembled it with their hands still waited for the passage they had been promised.

The tower was real. So was the shadow.

Viktor's daughter shifted beside her, pulling Miriam from her thoughts.

"I should go," the young woman said. "My shift starts in an hour."

"Thank you," Miriam said. "For staying."

The woman paused at the alcove's entrance. For a moment she seemed about to say something else—something that had edges to it, something she'd been carrying. Then she just nodded, once, and left.

Her footsteps faded down the corridor, leaving Miriam alone with the view.

---

The stars were brighter now—or perhaps her eyes had adjusted. The Milky Way sprawled across the dark, a river of light she had never seen so clearly.

She had spent her career building a tower to the stars. Standing here, she could finally see how far the stars actually were. The tether stretched thirty-six thousand kilometers—an impossible distance by any human scale. And that distance was nothing. A rounding error. The nearest star was four light-years away.

*We're climbing anyway.*

The thought brought no comfort. It was simply true.

---

The horizon had completed its transformation. The thin bright line had become a mere suggestion, a whisper of color at the planet's edge. Above it: black. Below it: the curved expanse of Earth, wrapped in weather, holding everything she had ever known.

She was above the sky.

The phrase surfaced from some half-remembered poem, her school days in Lagos. Her father had loved poetry—had recited it while they walked the bridges he was inspecting. He would have loved this view. He would have wept at it.

She had inherited his attention to structure and his capacity for feeling. She had buried the feeling to survive the attention. Standing here, with no one watching, she let it surface.

Her eyes stung. She blinked, and the stars blurred, and something warm tracked down her cheek.

The tear drifted slowly in the reduced gravity. She watched it descend until it caught on the viewport's frame, a small bright bead of saltwater.

---

The climber rose.

Miriam stood at the viewport and watched the edge of space become the middle of space, watched the atmosphere shrink to a memory, watched the stars claim the sky in their slow and permanent victory. 

She thought of Yusuf Haddad, somewhere in the economy decks. She thought of Teiti Nakibae, searching for a reef that would never return. She thought of 1,247 names she had never really learned, had allowed to remain abstractions even as their lives were spent to build her vision.

She would have to start there. With the names. With what she had let herself not know.

The book she kept abandoning—maybe that was why she kept abandoning it. She had been trying to write about the tower without writing about the dead. As if the elegance could be separated from the cost.

---

Miriam stood at the viewport, her hand flat against the glass, and watched the stars burn in the eternal dark. Behind her, the climber hummed with life. Above her, the tether stretched toward destinations she had only imagined.

She had crossed the threshold. They all had. There was no going back to the atmosphere they had left behind, or to the people they had been before they saw the view from this height.

She didn't know yet what she would become.

The stars watched, indifferent and eternal.

Miriam watched back.

And the climber rose on, patient and relentless, toward whatever waited at the top.
