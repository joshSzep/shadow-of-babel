# Chapter 7: The Chairman's Arrival

The smile was already in place when the aircraft door opened.

Kenji stepped into the equatorial light with the practiced ease of a man photographed ten thousand times. The heat hit immediately—Pacific humidity that climate control could temper but never defeat—and sweat prickled at his collar even as his face remained composed. Behind him, handlers moved in choreographed formation: Yuki with his schedule, Tanaka with his talking points, the security detail whose names he had stopped learning years ago.

The ceremonial platform spread before him, draped in Consortium blue and the gold of half a dozen flags. Dignitaries waited in arranged rows, faces bright with the anticipation of being photographed with someone important. Beyond them, the press pool—cameras already tracking, the machinery of witness already in motion.

And above everything, rising from the heart of the Ascension District like a blade of frozen light, the tether.

Kenji let his eyes travel up its length as he descended—a gesture that would photograph well. The running lights pulsed red and white against the morning blue, patient as heartbeats. *Takeshi, I'm here. Finally taking the ride you never got to take.*

The thought arrived without ceremony and departed the same way. No time for ghosts. Only the next handshake.

---

"Chairman Murakami, on behalf of the Consortium Executive Council, welcome to Te Rarawa."

Director Nakamura's handshake was precisely calibrated—firm enough to convey respect, brief enough to keep the line moving. Hiro could process a dignitary in under eight seconds while making them feel personally welcomed.

"Director." Kenji returned the grip with equal precision. "Everything in order?"

"Ahead of schedule. VIP credentials processed, media briefings complete. Ready for your remarks."

"The worker delegation?"

Something flickered in Hiro's expression—surprise that Kenji had asked. "Boarding through the eastern channel. No incidents."

"Good." Kenji moved on, already extending his hand to the next dignitary.

Admiral Crawford, American security interests—handshake military-crisp, greeting perfunctory. Jean-Claude Dubois from ESA, idealism ground to a nub by committee work. Victoria Chen-Worthington, whose financial architecture underpinned everything and who smiled at Kenji with the cool assessment of someone calculating his remaining usefulness.

He smiled back. He always smiled back.

Mohammed Al-Rashid, energy sector, orbital solar finally paying off. Dr. Fatou Mensah, materials scientist who had worked alongside Miriam—Kenji saw her eyes flick toward the public terminal and wondered if she was thinking what he was thinking. Isabella Restrepo, General Counsel, who knew every clause of every agreement because she had written most of them.

And then, at the end of the line, a face that made Kenji's smile falter for a fraction of a second.

"Mr. Chairman." President Teannaki Kamoriki's handshake was warmer than the others, more personal, and more dangerous for it. "It's been too long."

"Mr. President." Kenji recovered instantly. "I'm honored you could join us. This voyage means more with Kiribati's leadership aboard."

Teannaki's eyes—dark, patient, seeing everything—held Kenji's a beat longer than protocol required. "It's not every day one rides the tower built on one's homeland. I thought I should see it from the inside."

The words were pleasant. The weight beneath them was not.

"I hope the journey exceeds expectations," Kenji said. The words tasted like nothing.

Teannaki nodded slowly, filing something away. "I'm sure it will be educational."

The press briefing was held in a glass-walled pavilion overlooking the departure plaza. Through the windows, the climber waited—200 meters of silver-white engineering, running lights pulsing, observation ports gleaming. It looked like a cathedral given permission to move. It looked like everything Takeshi had promised and everything the promises had cost.

"Chairman Murakami, thank you for joining us."

The moderator was part of Priya Mehta's communications team, trained to facilitate without intruding. The press pool was more memorable: faces Kenji recognized from decades of coverage, cameras he had learned to treat as extensions of the public eye.

He found Amara Diallo in the second row without meaning to look for her. Global News Alliance. Sharp questions, careful follow-ups, the kind of journalism that made Priya nervous. She had asked Henrik about the workers yesterday. She would ask Kenji about something worse.

The teleprompter glowed. Kenji began to speak.

"Today marks a turning point in human history. The Babel Elevator has been operational for over a decade, carrying cargo and personnel to orbit. But this maiden public voyage represents something more—a promise fulfilled, a future opened, a door that will never close again."

The words flowed smoothly, rehearsed to automaticity. International cooperation. Takeshi Yamazaki's vision. The thousands who had worked to make this day possible. The lottery system. The scholarship program.

He did not speak of the 1,247 names on the Shadow Memorial. He did not speak of passage promises made and broken. He did not speak of the ticket he had sent to a man who had saved his life nineteen years ago.

"Questions?"

Hands rose. The moderator steered toward friendly inquiries—technical questions, human interest, political softballs Kenji could answer with platitudes.

Then Amara Diallo's hand went up, and the moderator called on her.

"Chairman Murakami." Her voice was measured, professional. "The Consortium made specific commitments to construction workers regarding passage rights. Many are still in the anchor city, still waiting. What is your response to criticism that this voyage prioritizes wealth and political connection over the builders who made it possible?"

The room shifted. Cameras adjusted. Kenji felt the familiar tightening in his shoulders—the one that preceded saying something he didn't believe.

He adjusted his cufflinks.

"Worker passage has always been a Consortium priority. This voyage includes fifty seats allocated through the Builders' Union—a direct acknowledgment of contributions made during construction. The lottery system ensures access isn't limited to those with means. We're committed to expanding these programs."

"And the specific promises made during recruitment? The commitments that workers would receive guaranteed passage upon completion of their contracts?"

"Historical commitments under previous leadership are being reviewed—"

"With respect, Chairman, you were part of that leadership. You were Takeshi Yamazaki's protégé during construction. Were you aware of the promises being made?"

The room went very still.

Kenji looked at Amara Diallo and saw, for a moment, another face—darker, older, bearing weathered lines of years in orbital construction and scars of accidents that should never have happened. A face that had looked at him across an emergency compartment in 2066: *Do you see now? Do you see what they're doing to us?*

"I was aware," Kenji said quietly. "And I have worked within the Consortium to honor those commitments to the extent possible. I acknowledge that more needs to be done. The review I mentioned is genuine, and its findings will be made public."

More than he had planned to say. Less than the truth. The narrow gap between them where Kenji Murakami had learned to live.

"Thank you, Chairman." Amara's expression was unreadable. "I look forward to that review."

The moderator moved quickly to the next question. Kenji answered on autopilot, still caught on what he had almost said. What he had chosen not to say.

---

The transit corridor between the press pavilion and the VIP terminal was climate-controlled, silent, and—for thirty precious seconds—empty.

Kenji stopped walking.

Handlers ahead, already through the next checkpoint. Security behind, maintaining distance. For half a minute, he stood alone in a corridor of glass and carbon fiber, the tether visible through the transparent ceiling, rising until it vanished into blue already shading toward black.

He removed his glasses and pinched the bridge of his nose. The exhaustion surged forward—a physical weight on his shoulders, his chest, the space behind his eyes. Fifty-eight years old. Twenty-three of them spent in service to this structure, this vision that had belonged to Takeshi and now belonged to everyone and no one and him.

*What would you think, old man? What would you say?*

He had asked a thousand times. He had stopped expecting an answer years ago.

A portrait of Takeshi hung in the terminal ahead—one of hundreds, the founder's face reproduced so often it had become iconography rather than memory. In the portrait, Takeshi looked past the viewer, toward something only he could see. Serene. Visionary. Empty of the doubt that had plagued his final years.

Kenji had been with him at the end. The hospital bed in Osaka. Machines beeping while the cancer finished what decades of work had started. Takeshi's last words: *Is it still rising?*

Kenji had said yes. It was still rising. It would always be rising.

He hadn't mentioned the cost. By then, Takeshi already knew.

A door opened behind him. Footsteps approached. The moment of privacy ended.

Kenji put his glasses on, straightened his shoulders, and walked toward the terminal.

---

The VIP boarding lounge was designed to make wealth feel natural.

Soft lighting, living walls, furniture in clusters suggesting intimacy without enforcing it. Through floor-to-ceiling windows, the climber waited—close enough to see individual observation ports, the subtle curve of the hull that Miriam had specified for stress loads in the lower atmosphere.

Miriam. She was here somewhere. He had seen her name on the manifest, felt something complicated move through his chest—relief, dread, old resentment calcified into something he couldn't name. She had left when leaving was the moral choice. He had stayed when staying was the necessary one. Neither of them had been right.

He would see her eventually. Seven days of enforced proximity with every ghost he had been avoiding.

"Chairman." Hiro appeared at his elbow. "The welcome reception begins in forty minutes. Director Lindqvist has requested a meeting—something about the Hashimoto partnership."

"Henrik can wait." Kenji accepted water from a passing steward. "Status on the worker delegation?"

Again, that flicker of surprise in Hiro's expression. "Boarding completed. Economy section. Union representatives cooperative."

"Any issues?"

"One of the elders refused VIP processing. Insisted on the standard worker channel." Hiro's tone carried professional disapproval. "We accommodated."

Teiti Nakibae. Kenji didn't need to ask. He had seen her file—husband's death in the anchor collapse, footage of her standing before the Consortium board fifteen years ago demanding the dead be remembered. She had refused the settlement offer. Organized the first memorial. The security assessment called her "a person of significant influence" and "unlikely to disrupt proceedings if handled respectfully."

*Handled.* As if she were a logistical problem rather than a woman who had buried a husband in the structure he now commanded.

"Make sure she has everything she needs. No special treatment unless she requests it. Keep the handlers at a distance."

Hiro made a note. "Anything else?"

The question was on his tongue—*Yusuf Haddad, economy passenger, discretionary ticket*—but he didn't ask. He already knew. He had checked the manifest three times in his Tokyo office.

"No. That's all."

---

The reception was everything receptions always were: champagne, handshakes, the social lubrication of power.

Kenji moved through it like a fish through familiar water. He congratulated Henrik on the Stellar Foundation and endured five minutes of self-congratulation. He discussed orbital manufacturing with Lin Xiaoming, whose presence surprised him—the tech billionaire was known for criticizing the Consortium, not riding its elevator. He accepted Ambassador Sharma's pleasantries and wondered what India really wanted.

Through it all, he smiled. Made eye contact. Asked questions that invited people to talk about themselves. The perfect host—attentive, gracious, impossible to pin down.

At one point, he found himself near the window, momentarily alone, and let his gaze drift to the plaza below.

The VIP terminal was elevated, offering a clear view. Standard boarding queues—lottery winners, national allocations, scholarship recipients—moving in patient lines. Press pool relocating, cameras tracking something.

And beyond, almost at the edge of visibility, the worker channel.

Kenji watched them moving through the final checkpoint. Men and women in their fifties and sixties, mostly. Clothes neat but not expensive. Faces carrying the particular dignity of people who had earned something and come to collect.

One was shorter than the others, stocky, moving with a slight limp. Gray in his beard. His left hand rose briefly to adjust a bag strap—and even from this distance, Kenji could see the silhouette was wrong. Two fingers missing, stumps healed but unmistakable. He remembered the medical report from 2066: *Worker Haddad declined reconstructive options. Claims he wants to remember.*

Kenji's hand tightened on his water glass.

He turned away.

"Chairman?" Henrik had materialized beside him, champagne in hand. "Wonderful event. The Consortium really knows how to mark an occasion."

"It's a historic day," Kenji said, hearing the emptiness in his own voice and compensating with warmth. "You wanted to discuss Hashimoto?"

"When you have a moment. Nothing urgent." Henrik's eyes drifted toward the window. "Remarkable, isn't it? The scale. My father used to say Yamazaki was the last true visionary—a man who saw centuries ahead. And here we are, seeing what he saw."

"Here we are."

"I spoke with one of the scholarship students earlier. Zara Chen-Okafor—brilliant young physicist. Interesting questions about oscillation dampening." Henrik's smile widened. "The next generation is ready. That's what this is about, isn't it? Building something that outlasts us."

Kenji thought of Yusuf, somewhere in the economy section now. The ticket he had sent—no note, no explanation—for a voyage that should have been Yusuf's by right decades ago.

Building something that outlasts us. Yes. But not in the way Henrik meant.

"If you'll excuse me," Kenji said, "I should make the rounds."

---

The boarding announcement came at 14:00.

Kenji stood at the VIP gate with the other dignitaries, watching the choreography of departure unfold. Press pool repositioned—Chairman leading passengers aboard, the symbolic beginning.

He thought about what he would say at the departure ceremony. The speech for the Hub. Words written for him, polished by Priya's team, designed to inspire without committing.

He thought about Yusuf, somewhere behind him in a different queue.

Nineteen years of silence. One ticket. No note.

*Why did you send it?* he imagined Yusuf asking. *Guilt? Debt? Absolution?*

He didn't know. He had asked himself a hundred times since entering Yusuf's name into the system. The answer refused to hold still.

*Because you saved my life, and I never thanked you.*

*Because you showed me the truth, and I didn't change enough.*

*Because this might be my last chance to—*

To what? Apologize? Explain? Stand before a man he had failed and accept whatever judgment came?

The gate opened. The ceremony began. Kenji walked forward, cameras tracking, smile in place, the weight of everything he carried invisible to everyone except himself.

The climber waited.

The tether rose.

And somewhere in the queues behind him, a man he had not spoken to in nineteen years was boarding the structure they had both helped build.

---

The VIP entrance led to the upper decks, where architecture shifted from functional to luxurious. Kenji's suite was on Level 20—highest passenger accommodation, just below command deck. Two rooms, private observation port, amenities that would have seemed impossible to the boy from Kobe dreaming of his grandfather's rebuilding stories.

He dismissed the steward. Declined the champagne. Stood at the observation port and looked down at Te Rarawa—rings of light spreading from the tether, service zones and sprawl, a city built on a reef that no longer existed.

From here, he could not see the workers' quarter. Could not see the Shadow Memorial or the maneaba or the outer rings where people lived in structures that had been temporary for twenty years. Only the Ascension District: gleaming, perfect, designed to inspire awe.

The gap between what he could see and what he knew was there—that gap was where Kenji Murakami lived.

*You think in decades,* Takeshi had said. *So do I.*

And he did. Decades, generations, the long arc of human expansion. Children who would take orbital access for granted. Industries beyond Earth's gravity well. Species-level survival.

He also thought about 1,247 names on a wall. Promises made and broken. A man in the economy section who had saved his life and received a ticket instead of justice.

The climber shuddered faintly—systems warming up, machinery preparing for the long pull upward. In a few hours, the ascent. In seven days, the Hub.

Seven days in a sealed vessel with everyone he had been avoiding.

Seven days to decide what, if anything, he was willing to say.

Kenji removed his glasses and set them beside the untouched champagne. He loosened his tie—a small rebellion, private, invisible. He sat facing the observation port and let his head fall back.

The tether rose beyond the glass, silver-white against the afternoon sky, running lights pulsing.

*Is it still rising?*

Yes, Takeshi. It's still rising.

The question was whether anything else was.
