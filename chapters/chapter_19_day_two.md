# Chapter 19: Day Two

## I. Zara

The morning briefing was at 0730, in the scholarship cohort's designated lounge on Level 8.

Zara had been awake since 0515, unable to sleep through the transition—not of altitude, but of light. The climber's rotation meant that dawn arrived differently here than on Earth, the sun sweeping across the viewport in a motion that had nothing to do with planetary rotation, everything to do with the vessel's slow spin along the tether's axis. She had watched the terminator line cross Earth's surface below them—night giving way to day across half a continent in a matter of minutes—and felt her internal clock surrender.

Day two. They had been rising for thirty-one hours. The altitude readout on her tablet said 3,200 kilometers and climbing.

"Good morning, everyone." David's voice carried the bright insistence of someone who had practiced sincerity until it became indistinguishable from the real thing. The PR handler stood at the front of the lounge, tablet in hand, smile fixed like a setting on a dial. "We have a full schedule today. Breakfast in the common dining room at 0800—you'll be seated with members of the Business Deck delegation, excellent networking opportunity. At 1000, there's a science presentation in the observation dome that you're all expected to attend. Dr. Matsumoto will be explaining the physics of tether dynamics. At 1400—"

Zara stopped listening. She had the schedule on her tablet; she didn't need it narrated. What she needed was coffee, and perhaps an hour alone with a viewport, and the answer to a question that had kept her awake alongside the wrong-angled dawn.

*Decoration or demonstration?*

Amara Diallo had asked her, during the interview, what she thought the scholarship program was really for. Zara had given the approved answer—access, opportunity, the democratization of space. But even as she'd said it, she'd heard how it sounded. Rehearsed. The kind of answer that existed because someone needed it to exist.

She wasn't sure what the real answer was. That was the problem. She couldn't tell if she was being used or if she was being paranoid about being used, and the uncertainty made her feel young in a way she hated.

"—and of course, we'll need the official cohort photo at 1630. Full Stellar Foundation attire, please. The backdrop will be Earth from the upper observation level. Very symbolic."

*Decoration*, Zara thought. *We're the backdrop to the backdrop.*

Beside her, Tomoko Ishida—another scholarship student, from Kyoto, studying orbital agriculture—leaned close. "You look tired."

"I watched the sunrise."

"Which one?"

Zara almost laughed. It was a fair question. The climber's rotation meant that they experienced a kind of sunrise every ninety minutes, the sun sliding past different viewports as the vessel turned. "The real one. Earth's terminator."

Tomoko nodded as if this made perfect sense. "I watched the stars. Did you know you can see the Andromeda galaxy without a telescope from here?"

"I didn't."

"It's just a smudge. But it's there. Two million light-years away, and I saw it with my eyes." Tomoko's voice held wonder without performance. "That's the farthest thing I've ever seen."

Zara felt something shift in her chest. This was why she was here. Not the networking opportunities, not the symbolic photos, not the approved talking points about access and opportunity. This. The simple fact of seeing further than any human could see from Earth's surface, and sharing that seeing with someone who understood what it meant.

"After breakfast," she said, "do you want to find a viewport away from the scheduled events?"

Tomoko smiled. "I know one. Level 12, near the maintenance corridor. Almost no one goes there."

## II. Kenji

The morning briefing was at 0700, in the operations center on Level 3.

Kenji had been awake since 0430, reviewing reports from the overnight watch, cross-referencing passenger movements against the optimized crowd-flow models his team had developed. The maiden voyage was proceeding nominally. That word—*nominally*—appeared in every status update, every system check, every communication from the bridge. It was a word designed to calm, to reassure, to suggest that everything was exactly as planned.

Kenji had learned to hear what the word concealed.

"Passenger satisfaction metrics are holding at 94% across all tiers." Director Nakamura scrolled through data on the main display. "Premium Deck is at 97%, which is actually slightly below projection—we had some complaints about the observation deck scheduling. Business is at 95%. Standard is at 92%. Economy at 89%."

"Why the differential?" Kenji asked, though he knew the answer.

"The usual factors. Economy passengers have less access to premium amenities, longer queues for shared facilities. We anticipated this." Nakamura tapped to a new screen. "The lottery winners are actually scoring higher than expected—Elena Reyes and her family are at 98% satisfaction. The media coverage of their experience has been overwhelmingly positive."

Kenji thought of Elena Reyes—the grandmother he had seen at the observation deck the day before, standing with her granddaughter, both of them pressing their hands against the glass. The child had been laughing. The grandmother had been weeping. Neither reaction had seemed performed.

*That's real*, something in him had thought. *Whatever else is managed about this voyage, that was real.*

"What about the worker-passengers?" he asked.

A slight hesitation. Nakamura's eyes flicked to the other staff present—Lieutenant Chen from Communications, Chief Steward Volkov, two junior operations officers. "The labor delegation is—challenging to survey. They've been less responsive to our satisfaction protocols."

"Less responsive."

"They're not completing the optional feedback forms. And their participation in scheduled social events has been lower than projected."

*They don't trust us*, Kenji translated. *They remember what we promised and what we delivered.*

He thought of Yusuf Haddad—the name that had been burning in his mind since he sent the ticket, the face he had glimpsed at the observation deck and then deliberately not approached. Nineteen years since the accident that should have killed Kenji and didn't, that had killed others and shouldn't have. Nineteen years since Yusuf had pulled him from the wreckage, had held his hand while they waited for rescue, had said words Kenji still heard in his dreams.

*You're going to be okay. I've got you.*

The ticket had been a summons. Or an apology. Or a question. Kenji still wasn't sure which.

"Chairman." Lieutenant Chen's voice cut through his thoughts. "We have a communication flagged for your attention. From the surface."

"Which surface communication?"

"Protests at the Grand Terminal. The overnight watch recorded significant escalation. The Grounded movement is blockading the secondary access roads. Local security has made arrests."

Kenji felt the familiar weight settle onto his shoulders. The protests had been expected—were always expected—but the timing complicated everything. The maiden voyage was being broadcast to billions; every image was being curated, managed, contextualized. Protest footage mixed poorly with the narrative of triumph.

"Show me."

The display shifted to a split screen: on one side, the terminal's exterior cameras; on the other, feed from Consortium security drones. The crowds were larger than the projections had suggested—perhaps ten thousand people, with banners and chants and the particular energy that meant this wasn't going away quietly. The blockade had closed two of the three access routes to the terminal. Supply vehicles were being rerouted. A line of security personnel in riot gear faced a line of protesters with linked arms.

"Has any of this reached the passenger communications systems?" Kenji asked.

"Not yet. Passengers have access to curated news feeds, which we control. But several journalists aboard have independent satellite links. Ms. Diallo from Le Monde has already filed two stories mentioning the protests. We can't prevent that."

Kenji nodded slowly. Of course they couldn't prevent it. The journalists were here precisely because preventing coverage would be worse than allowing it. The strategy was to provide so much approved content that the unapproved content would be drowned out. It usually worked.

But there was something in the footage—the size of the crowd, the determination in the faces, the banners that read *ACCESS FOR ALL* and *THE SKY BELONGS TO EVERYONE* and, in hand-painted letters, *1,247 DIED FOR THIS*—that made Kenji wonder if the usual strategies would be enough.

"What's our response protocol?" he asked.

"The prepared statement emphasizes our commitment to expanded access through the lottery program," Chen said. "We highlight the labor representatives aboard the maiden voyage—"

"Don't." The word came out sharper than Kenji intended. He took a breath, modulated. "Don't use the workers as a shield. Not today."

Chen looked uncertain. Nakamura's expression remained carefully neutral.

"Then what would the Chairman prefer?"

Kenji studied the protestors on the screen. A young woman at the front of the line was being handcuffed. She was smiling, even as the security officers pulled her arms behind her back. Her banner lay on the ground beside her: *MY FATHER BUILT YOUR ELEVATOR. WHERE'S HIS TICKET?*

"Acknowledge the protests," Kenji said. "Don't argue with them. Don't explain them away. Just acknowledge that people are exercising their right to express their views."

"That's—" Nakamura hesitated. "That's not consistent with our messaging strategy."

"Our messaging strategy was designed for normal operations. This is the maiden voyage. Everything we do sets precedent." Kenji turned away from the screen. "I'll draft the statement myself."

He left the operations center before anyone could object, walking the corridor toward his private office, feeling the weight of 3,200 kilometers of altitude pressing down on him from above.

## III. Henrik

Breakfast in the Premium Deck dining room was served at 0830.

Henrik had reserved a table by the viewport—the best table, the one where Earth filled the glass like a painting commissioned specifically for his morning coffee. He had dressed carefully: casual elegance, the kind that cost more than formal wear but suggested that wealth was simply how one existed, not something one displayed. Charcoal sweater, Italian. Trousers tailored in Stockholm. No tie—ties were for people who still needed to prove things.

The Earth below him had changed overnight. From here—3,200 kilometers up, and rising—the curvature was unmistakable. The planet was a ball, wrapped in weather, blue and white and brown, impossibly beautiful in ways that his aesthetic sensibilities struggled to categorize. He had seen photographs, of course. Everyone had seen photographs. But photographs were flat, contained, controllable. This view was none of those things.

The waiter approached. Henrik didn't look up.

"Mr. Lindqvist. Your usual?"

"Yes. And send a bottle of champagne to the Reyes family's cabin. The '71 Krug. With a note: 'Welcome to the journey.'"

A pause. "The Reyes family is on Standard Deck, sir. Our champagne service doesn't extend—"

"Then extend it." Henrik finally met the waiter's eyes. Young, probably Eastern European, with the particular blankness of someone trained to have no opinions. "Is that a problem?"

"No, sir. I'll make the arrangements."

The waiter withdrew. Henrik returned his attention to the view, satisfied. The gesture was generous, appropriate—the lottery-winning family deserved to share in the voyage's pleasures. He imagined their faces when the bottle arrived: the grandmother's surprise, the little girl's delight, the father perhaps raising the glass in a toast toward Premium Deck, toward him.

He did not imagine them refusing it. He did not consider that a bottle delivered by uniformed staff, with his name attached, might land differently than he intended. He did not wonder whether generosity from above ever felt like something other than generosity.

He didn't check. He didn't ask. He finished his breakfast feeling virtuous, and by the time his coffee arrived, he had moved on to other thoughts.

The Reyes family never mentioned the bottle to anyone. Henrik never learned what they did with it. In this way, his gesture cost him nothing at all.

Miriam Okonkwo entered the dining room.

Henrik watched her navigate between tables—the careful way she moved, acknowledging no one, selecting a table far from the windows, positioning herself with her back to the view. She ordered tea—he could tell from the waiter's posture, the quick nod, the absence of the elaborate service that accompanied coffee in this room.

She was avoiding him.

Good. That was fine. Their conversation at the reception had been—uncomfortable. She had looked at him with those dark, assessing eyes and asked questions he didn't want to answer. Questions about the Foundation's real purpose, about access versus optics, about the difference between charity and justice.

*You fund scholarships. But you also fund the Consortium. How do you reconcile those investments?*

He hadn't answered. He had changed the subject, smoothly, the way he had been trained. But the question had stayed with him through the night, mixing with the impossible view, the strange angle of the stars, the sense that something was shifting in how he understood himself.

His tablet chimed. A message from his assistant in Stockholm: *Morning briefing attached. Orbital mining consortium proposal moving forward. Your approval needed by EOD.*

Business. Reality. The world he understood.

Henrik opened the briefing, let the numbers scroll past his eyes, and tried not to think about the woman across the room who designed the tower he was climbing and now couldn't look at the world she had helped humanity reach.

## IV. Yusuf

The workers' mess hall on Level 14 served breakfast from 0600 to 0900.

Yusuf had arrived at 0615, when the space was nearly empty—a few overnight crew coming off shift, a couple of early-rising lottery winners who seemed overwhelmed by the buffet. He had filled a plate without looking at the options, found a table near the viewport, and sat there watching the Earth shrink.

Three thousand two hundred kilometers. He had built sections of the tether at altitudes half that—working the mid-reach crews, moving hand over hand through vacuum while the cable stretched above and below him like a thread spun by gods. He knew the distances in his body, in the ache of muscles that had pulled against harnesses, in the phantom pressure of a suit that had been his skin for months at a time.

Now he was inside the thing he had built. Riding it. Rising.

The viewport showed him Earth—curved, blue, perfect. He looked for Te Rarawa and couldn't find it. The Pacific was a vast expense of water and cloud, the Phoenix Islands invisible at this scale. All that remained of the reef, the islands, the world Teiti had known—vanished into the blur of distance.

*Did it hurt this much to build?* he wondered. *Or did the hurting come later, when they took away what we were promised?*

Carlos Reyes dropped into the seat across from him. The older man's plate was piled high—eggs, sausage, fruit, pastries, the kind of abundance that workers' mess halls never offered during construction.

"You're brooding again." Carlos spoke Jordanian Arabic, their private language among the polyglot workers aboard. "The view is better than your face. Look at it."

"I'm looking."

"You're looking at what's not there. The reef. The islands. The past." Carlos shook his head, chewing. "Look at what is there. We're in space, Yusuf. After everything—we're in space."

Yusuf didn't answer. He had come to terms with the voyage in his own way—or he was trying to. The ticket Kenji had sent, without explanation, without apology, without contact in nineteen years. The decision to accept it, to leave Fatima and the children, to climb the tower that had consumed his best years and given him nothing but scars.

*Why did you send it?* The question burned in him. *What do you want from me?*

"The news from below is bad," Carlos said, lowering his voice. "The protests are getting bigger. Mei Chen is trying to keep it off the main feeds, but people are talking. The Grounded have blockaded the terminal."

"Good."

"Is it?" Carlos studied him. "They're fighting for access. We have access. We're here."

"We're here because one man's guilt outweighed his promises." The words came out harder than Yusuf intended. "I didn't earn this ticket. I didn't win a lottery. I was given it because Kenji Murakami can't sleep at night."

"You don't know that."

"I know." Yusuf touched the space over his chest, where the ticket had rested in his pocket for months before he decided to use it. "He didn't send a note. Didn't ask if I wanted it. Just—handed me passage, like a gift, like compensation. As if nineteen years of silence could be erased by a ticket to the stars."

Carlos was quiet for a moment, working through the implications. He had been there, at the accident—had heard the stories, at least, passed down through the worker networks. Everyone knew the story of Section 47, and the Chairman who had nearly died, and the worker who saved him.

"What will you do?" Carlos asked finally.

Yusuf looked at the Earth below, shrinking, resolving into something he could hold with his eyes. All the pain of the surface—Fatima's tears, the children's confusion, the protests at the terminal, the broken promises and the endless waiting—all of it reduced to a blue marble hanging in the dark.

"I'll find him," Yusuf said. "Before this voyage ends. I'll find him and ask him why."

## V. Amara

The press room on Level 5 was quiet at 1100.

Most of the journalists had dispersed to chase scheduled events—the science presentation, the VIP brunch, the endless photo opportunities that the Consortium staged with assembly-line efficiency. Amara remained at her workstation, surrounded by notes and recordings and the nagging sense that the real story was somewhere she hadn't looked yet.

The interview with Zara Chen-Okafor played in her earpiece, on loop.

*"They chose us to be symbols. Proof that the elevator is for everyone. But symbols don't change systems. Symbols just make systems more palatable."*

Amara had been a journalist for eighteen years. She had covered refugee crises and corporate scandals and the slow-motion collapse of coastlines under rising seas. She knew the difference between a story that changed things and a story that let people feel better about things staying the same.

The maiden voyage was supposed to be the second kind. Triumph. Achievement. Humanity reaching for the stars. Her editors wanted uplift—wanted images of Earth from above, quotes from passengers moved to tears, the narrative of progress that their readers craved.

But the story she was finding was more complicated.

*The scholarship students, displayed at corporate receptions.*

*The lottery winners, photographed and quoted and managed.*

*The workers, aboard but separate, their presence proof of access even as they ate in different dining rooms and slept on different decks.*

*And Teiti Nakibae—the elder who had refused VIP boarding, who had gathered the I-Kiribati passengers for a ceremony that wasn't on any official schedule, who carried the names of the dead like an obligation.*

Amara hadn't been able to document the ceremony. It had happened in a storage bay, after hours, with no press invited. But she had heard about it—whispers among the crew, a brief mention in the passenger communications logs she wasn't supposed to have access to but did. Something had happened there, something that mattered, something that didn't fit the approved narrative.

Her tablet chimed. An incoming call, flagged priority.

Sophie. Her daughter. Calling from Paris, where it was early evening, where the world continued to turn at the normal pace.

Amara answered, and her daughter's face filled the screen—twelve years old, wise beyond her years, with her father's cheekbones and Amara's eyes.

"Maman. I saw the photos from the observation deck. You look tired."

"I'm not sleeping well. The light is strange here."

"The time difference must be terrible."

Amara almost laughed. There was no time zone in space—only the arbitrary schedule the Consortium imposed, synced to Te Rarawa's local time. "It's different," she said. "Not terrible. Just—different."

Sophie was quiet for a moment, studying her mother through the screen. "You're working on something. I can tell. You have that look."

"What look?"

"The one where you're thinking about something important and not telling me about it."

Amara felt a familiar pang—the guilt of the working mother, the fear that she was missing something essential, the knowledge that Sophie would understand and forgive her for it anyway. Her daughter had grown up with a mother who chased stories. She had learned early that the chasing mattered.

"There's a story here," Amara said. "Under the official story. I'm still finding the edges of it."

"Is it important?"

Amara looked at the notes scattered across her workstation: Teiti Nakibae's name, circled three times. The memorial statistics—1,247 dead. The lottery analysis she had compiled, showing how the "random" selection process favored applicants from certain demographics. The scholarship program's corporate sponsors, cross-referenced against Consortium board members.

"I think so," she said. "I think it might be very important."

Sophie smiled—her father's smile, warm and encouraging. "Then find it, Maman. I'll be here when you get back."

The call ended. Amara sat in the quiet press room, surrounded by her notes, watching the Earth through the viewport. From here, she could see the curve of Africa's coast—her father's homeland, her own birthplace before the family moved to Senegal. The continent was a shape she knew by heart, wrapped in clouds, impossibly far away.

She pulled up her files on Teiti Nakibae and began to read again.

---

## VI. Teiti

The afternoon light came through the viewport at a strange angle.

Teiti had been sitting in the observation alcove for three hours, watching the Earth below, waiting for something she couldn't name. The ceremony the night before had left her emptied out—hollowed, clarified, ready. The names had been spoken. The songs had been sung. The dead had been honored in the old way, in the language of the ancestors, in the shadow of the tower built on their graves.

Now she waited.

The I-Kiribati called this state *te tei ni karaun*—the sitting of witness. It was an old practice, from before the missionaries, from before the colonial administration, from before the world had changed and changed again until nothing remained of the old ways except what the elders carried. You sat, and you watched, and you waited for the pattern to reveal itself.

The pattern here was complicated.

She had seen the young scholarship student—Zara, the one with the careful eyes—at the observation deck that morning. The girl had been with another student, Japanese perhaps, and they had found a corner away from the crowds, away from the cameras, and they had talked in low voices while watching the stars. Teiti had recognized something in the girl's posture—a tension, a questioning, a refusal to simply accept what she was told.

*Good*, Teiti had thought. *The young should question. The old should witness. This is how it has always been.*

She had seen the Chairman, too. Kenji Murakami, walking the corridors with his staff, performing calm while his eyes moved ceaselessly, searching for something or someone. Teiti knew the story—everyone in the workers' community knew the story. The accident at Section 47. The worker who had saved him. The silence that followed.

Yusuf Haddad was aboard. The Chairman knew it. The confrontation was coming.

*Te maiu ma te mate*, the ancestors said. *Life and death, bound together.*

The tower was like that. Life and death, bound in carbon and steel, rising through the void toward a future that held both possibilities. Teiti did not know which would win. She did not know if victory was even the right frame.

What she knew was this: her husband had died building this thing. Her people's homeland had been erased to anchor it. And now she was rising through the sky that had always held her ancestors' navigation stars, and the stars were still there, unchanged, patient as memory.

The observation alcove filled with afternoon light—Earth-light, reflected from the blue marble below. Teiti watched it paint the walls, the floor, her own weathered hands.

She was still waiting. The pattern had not yet revealed itself.

But it would. It always did.

## VII. Miriam

At 1623, the climber shuddered.

Miriam felt it through the floor of her cabin—a vibration that didn't match the normal rhythm, a frequency that was wrong. She was on her feet before her conscious mind had processed the data, her hand reaching for the wall, her engineer's instincts screaming *alert*.

The shudder lasted two seconds. Then it stopped.

Normal operation resumed. The climber continued its ascent, humming along the tether at 220 meters per second, carrying its cargo of five hundred passengers and seventy-five crew toward a destination that grew no closer in any visible way.

Miriam stood frozen, her palm pressed against the cabin wall, feeling for vibrations that weren't there anymore.

*Harmonic resonance. Something excited the system.*

She pulled up her tablet, navigated to the engineering readouts she wasn't supposed to have access to but did. The diagnostics showed a brief spike in tether oscillation—nothing dangerous, well within operational parameters, but present. Real. A note from the Captain's log: *Minor harmonic event detected at 1623. Dampening systems engaged. Normal operations continuing.*

That was the official story. The reassuring story. The story that passengers needed to hear.

Miriam knew a different story.

The oscillation problem—her oscillation problem, the one she had solved thirty years ago—was never fully solved. It was managed. Contained. Suppressed through dampening systems that required constant calibration, constant monitoring, constant attention. The mathematics predicted that under certain conditions—rare conditions, combinations of climber mass and speed and atmospheric drag and solar heating—the suppressed oscillations could cascade.

The briefings called it "theoretical." The simulations called it "low probability." The insurance documents called it "acceptable risk."

Miriam called it the nightmare she had carried since the first climber test, the possibility she had tried to eliminate and couldn't quite.

The shudder had lasted two seconds. Harmless. A note in a log.

But she had felt it through the floor, through the wall, through the bones of the structure she had designed. And she knew—with the certainty of someone who had spent a lifetime with these equations—that something was building.

---

The observation deck was crowded at 1700.

Miriam had avoided it for most of the voyage, preferring the quiet alcoves, the empty corridors, the spaces where no one recognized her face. But the shudder had changed something. She needed to see the tether—the real tether, stretching above and below them into the infinite dark. She needed to reassure herself that it was still whole.

The deck was full of passengers watching the Earth. They had reached 3,800 kilometers now—the planet was unmistakably a sphere, the horizon curved, the atmosphere a thin bright line. The scholarship students were gathered near one viewport, the lottery winners near another. The Premium passengers had claimed the best sightlines, as always.

Miriam found a position near the access door, where she could see without being seen, where the tether itself was visible through an upper viewport—a thread of darkness against the stars, stretching toward geostationary orbit, toward the Hub, toward the future.

It looked stable. It looked eternal. It looked like exactly what she had designed.

*But you felt the shudder. You know what it means.*

She watched the tether climb into darkness and tried to calculate the probability of cascade. The numbers weren't comforting. The numbers were never comforting, not when you understood what they actually measured.

The observation deck buzzed with conversation, laughter, the sounds of humans experiencing wonder. A child pressed her hands against the glass—Elena Reyes's granddaughter, Miriam realized, recognizing the family from the media coverage. The girl was laughing, pointing at something, pulling her grandmother closer to see.

*They don't know*, Miriam thought. *They can't know. That's not their burden.*

It was hers. It had always been hers.

She left the observation deck before anyone recognized her, walking the corridors toward engineering, toward the systems she understood, toward the problem she might be the only person aboard qualified to solve.

---

## VIII. Kenji

The evening briefing was at 2000.

Kenji had spent the afternoon managing small crises—the protest coverage, the observation deck scheduling complaints, a dispute between two Premium passengers over whose assistant had priority for the communications array. The routine of management, the endless calibration of competing interests, the performance of control.

The shudder at 1623 had added a new dimension.

"The dampening systems are functioning normally." Director Nakamura's voice carried the certainty of someone reading from an approved script. "Captain Osei has confirmed that the harmonic event was well within parameters. There is no cause for concern."

"What caused it?" Kenji asked.

A pause. The operations center fell quiet.

"The preliminary analysis suggests a combination of factors," Nakamura said carefully. "Climber velocity, current solar activity, and a minor temperature differential in the tether coating. All of these are monitored and managed."

"But we didn't predict this specific event."

"No. The interaction of variables was—unexpected. But the systems responded appropriately."

Kenji nodded slowly, processing. The dampening systems had been designed by Miriam Okonkwo, decades ago. They had been tested, refined, certified as safe. But "unexpected" interactions were exactly the kind of thing that safety certifications couldn't fully account for.

"Is Dr. Okonkwo aware?"

Another pause. Nakamura's eyes flicked to Lieutenant Chen, then back to Kenji.

"We haven't—" He hesitated. "We weren't planning to brief passengers on operational details."

"Dr. Okonkwo isn't just a passenger. She designed the systems that prevented this event from becoming dangerous. If there's something she needs to know, she should know it."

The silence in the operations center was heavy with unspoken objections. Kenji could feel them: the protocols about passenger involvement in operations, the liability concerns, the desire to maintain the narrative of flawless performance. All of it valid. All of it beside the point.

"I'll speak with her myself," Kenji said. "Privately. Off the record."

He left the operations center before anyone could argue, walking the corridors toward the distinguished passenger suites, toward the woman who had made this tower possible and then walked away from it, toward a conversation he wasn't sure he knew how to have.

The climber rose through the endless dark, carrying them higher, carrying them forward, carrying them toward whatever awaited at the top of the longest structure humanity had ever built.

And somewhere in the levels below, Kenji knew, Yusuf Haddad was waiting too.

---

*End of Day Two. Altitude: 4,100 kilometers. Days remaining: 5.*
