# Chapter 36: Speaking the Names

The chapel was a small room near the top of the climber, meant for quiet and prayer. Someone had pushed the benches against the walls to clear the center. In near-weightlessness, the benches stayed where they were placed, floating a centimeter above their brackets.

Teiti drifted through the doorway and found her position at the center of the room. The woven pandanus of her mat turned slowly with her until she stilled herself with one hand against the air. The movement came from decades of practice, from years of swimming in currents that no longer existed.

People were already gathering. Workers mostly, faces familiar from the mess halls and corridors below. A few passengers too, drawn by word passed quietly from cabin to cabin. Yusuf Haddad floated near the back, his missing fingers curled against his thigh. Amara had positioned herself near the door, no recording device visible.

The room filled in silence. Teiti counted perhaps forty people, though more drifted in as she waited. In the front, the eleven other I-Kiribati aboard had gathered in a loose cluster. Some held hands. One young woman, Nei Teramoa, wept already, though the ceremony had not begun.

Teiti had spent three days preparing. Not the words. The words were simple. What required preparation was the breath, the voice, the body that would carry 1,247 names across an hour without failing.

She waited until the room settled. Until the last small sounds of shifting and breathing faded into the background hum of the climber's systems.

Then she began.

---

"On October 17, 2065, twenty-three workers died in the Anchor Collapse. A subsea reinforcement structure failed at forty meters depth. The welds were faulty. The warnings had been ignored. These are their names."

She drew breath. Her throat was dry. She had brought no water. This was deliberate. The discomfort would keep her present.

"Teriki Nakibae."

The name left her and hung in the air. Her husband. Thirty years of marriage. The calluses on his palms from rope work. The way he smelled of salt even after bathing. The last morning, coming off her shift as he headed to his, passing in the corridor, touching hands without speaking because nothing needed to be said.

She felt the catch in her throat. Let it be there. Did not force her voice smooth.

"Romulo Aguilar."

She had known Romulo. He had taught her the Filipino word for starlight. His wife had sent letters for two years after his death, letters Teiti had kept in a box she no longer opened.

"Sanjay Bhattacharya."

The engineer who had written the safety reports. Who had documented the faulty welds. Who had died in the structure his reports should have prevented.

"Fernanda Coelho. Omar Diop. Bambang Hartono. Fidelis Karani."

She moved through the names. Each one was a person she had known or known of. This was what it meant to have been there. The dead were not abstractions. The dead had eaten at the same tables, slept in the same barracks, complained about the same supervisors.

"Nguyen Duc Lam. Pedro Magalhaes."

Pedro had been the dive team leader. His last transmission was directing others toward escape routes. He knew he would not make it. He spent his final minutes helping.

"Baiteke Nakibae."

Teriki's cousin. She had been the one to tell his parents. The sound his mother made was still with her.

"Chukwuemeka Nwosu. Arnel Ocampo. Raul Pereira."

She spoke each name clearly, with a small pause between. The room absorbed them. In the front row, an older Filipino man had closed his eyes. His lips moved slightly, as if praying.

The remaining names followed. Rosa Santos. Kofi Tetteh. Maria Trinidad. The last few. Twenty-three in all.

The room was utterly still.

---

"On March 15, 2068, a bootstrap climber carrying repair materials suffered a drive failure at 12,000 kilometers. The crew of twelve attempted emergency descent. The climber fell for forty-seven minutes. All twelve died. The Consortium did not publicize their deaths. Their families were compensated in exchange for silence. Workers call them the Twelve."

She let the silence stretch. Forty-seven minutes. Long enough to know. Long enough to say goodbye to no one.

"Antonio Reyes."

The pilot. Two hundred ascents without incident before that day.

"Gregorio Buenaventura. Marisol Santos."

Marisol had been the communications officer. Her transmissions during the fall were recorded. She remained calm, reporting systems status until the end. The recording was classified. No one outside the Consortium had heard it. But workers spoke of it. How a twenty-nine-year-old woman faced death with technical precision, describing the failure as if filing a routine report.

"Benigno Aquino. Djoko Lukman. Bagus Wibowo. Dewi Santoso."

Near the back of the room, someone made a small sound. Teiti did not look up. This was not a performance. This was not for the audience. This was for the dead.

"Eko Pratama. Rosario Mendoza. Juanito Cruz. Mario Villanueva. Ricky Torres."

Twelve names. The room felt different now. A tension that had not been there before. Some passengers were looking at each other, confusion visible. They had not known about the Twelve. Of course they had not known. The Twelve were a secret, a story told only in workers' quarters and union halls.

Now the secret was spoken aloud in the place the Twelve had been denied.

---

"On September 14, 2062, a catastrophic ribbon break during the Thickening phase killed 847 workers. It was the single deadliest day in the elevator's construction. The Consortium declared three days of mourning. Construction resumed on day four."

Teiti paused. Her mouth was dry. Her voice was holding, but she could feel the strain building in her throat. She would need to pace herself.

"The dead came from twenty-three nations. I will speak their names by homeland, so they may be remembered together."

She began with China. One hundred and twenty-seven names.

"Bai Feng. Bai Xiulan. Cao Haoran. Cao Yufei. Chang Donghai."

She found a rhythm. Three seconds per name. A small pause between clusters to let her throat rest. The names accumulated. Chen. Deng. Ding. Dong. Du. Fan. Feng. Gao. Gu. Guo. Han.

The room listened. In near-weightlessness, there was nowhere to shift, no pews to creak, no feet to shuffle. The silence was absolute between the names.

Somewhere around the fiftieth name, her voice began to fray. A roughness at the edges. She did not slow down or clear her throat. The roughness was true.

The Filipino man in the front row had opened his eyes. He was watching her. Not with expectation. With recognition. He knew the cost.

After China came India. Ninety-eight names. Her voice cracked partway through. She paused, breathed, continued.

After India, the Philippines. Eighty-nine names. Then Indonesia. Seventy-six. Bangladesh. Fifty-eight.

Somewhere in Bangladesh, her voice gave out. The name came out as a whisper, almost inaudible. She stopped.

The silence stretched.

Then Yusuf Haddad pushed himself forward from the back of the room. He moved slowly, carefully, until he floated beside her. He did not touch her or speak to her. He simply reached out and took the list.

"Rahman, Farooq," he said. His voice was rough, Jordanian-accented, carrying its own decades of construction and loss.

Teiti let him continue. She floated beside him, her hands folded in her lap, and listened.

Yusuf took them through the rest of Bangladesh. Through Nigeria, 52 names. Through Kenya and Pakistan and Vietnam and all the others. When his voice faltered, another worker came forward. A young Vietnamese woman whose grandfather's name was on the list. She spoke the Vietnamese section. Then a Nigerian man. Then a Kenyan.

The names passed from voice to voice. The workers of the climber carrying the names of the workers who died.

Teiti listened to all of it. When the last name of Black Day was spoken, she was ready.

---

"Beyond the major disasters, 156 workers died in smaller incidents across four decades of construction. Falls. Decompressions. Equipment failures. Each death was individual. Together, they were the cost of building."

Her voice was raw now, a rasp that hurt with every syllable. She spoke anyway.

"Alejandro Vega, 2048. Fell from scaffold. Safety harness failed."

She did not read all 156 names. She read enough. She told enough stories.

"Chen Binghao, 2048. Crushed by falling beam during night shift. First recorded construction fatality."

"Rashid Iqbal, 2049. Drowned during underwater welding. Equipment failure."

"Taburimai Tong, 2051. Drowned during reef clearing. Caught in debris collection nets."

At this name, an older I-Kiribati man in the front made a sound. Teiti knew him. They had grown up on neighboring atolls. Taburimai had been his nephew.

"Ahmed Moussa, 2051. Heat stroke during eighteen-hour shift. Temperature forty-two degrees. Inadequate hydration stations."

She spoke of the crane collapse in 2050 that killed five. The boat capsizing in 2054 that killed three. The gas explosion. The scaffold failure. Deaths that accumulated year after year, unremarked except by those who had been there.

"Achille Mbeki, 2059. Lost during EVA at 5,000 kilometers. Tether severed by debris. Body never recovered."

Never recovered. Bodies that drifted into the void. Workers who became part of the space they were building.

---

"187 workers died of radiation-linked cancers between 2070 and 2085. The Consortium knew the risks. They did not inform the workers. They did not offer monitoring. When workers began to die, the deaths were classified as natural causes."

Teiti's voice was nearly gone now. Each word scraped against her throat. She continued.

"Arun Krishnamurthy. Lung cancer. He worked high-altitude repair from 2058 to 2065. He was fifty-two when he died."

"Chen Jianbo. Leukemia. His family was never informed of the radiation link."

"Emeka Nnamdi. Brain tumor. He died three months after the disclosure leak. He learned the truth and then he died."

She moved through the names. The cancers. The organ failures. The slow deaths that came decades after the work was done.

"Hiroshi Sato. Thyroid cancer. He refused the settlement. His family was blacklisted."

Around the room, people were weeping. Not dramatically, not with sound. Tears floating free in the near-weightlessness, catching the light, drifting away from faces.

"Jose Eduardo Martinez. Pancreatic cancer. Died before his case could be documented."

"Kwame Adjei. Lymphoma. Settlement: three months' wages."

She moved through the years. 2070 to 2075. 2076 to 2078, when the deaths peaked. She felt herself approaching the name. Felt her body preparing for it.

"Tebuke Nakibae."

Her voice broke. Not a crack but a break, the sound cutting off mid-syllable.

She floated in silence. Her son. Her boy who had grown up on the construction platform, who had learned to walk on floating barges. Who had coughed blood into her hands at the end.

The room waited.

She breathed. Once. Twice.

"Tebuke Nakibae," she said again, barely a whisper. "Lung cancer. Diagnosed 2077. Died 2078. Son of Teriki Nakibae. Father of Tokanang Nakibae. My son."

She let the words exist. Let the room hold them.

Then she continued. The rest of the radiation dead. Workers who died even as the elevator neared completion, who would never see what they had built.

---

"Twenty-two workers disappeared during Babel's construction. Bodies never recovered. Death certificates never issued. The Consortium says they deserted, or their records were lost, or they never existed."

Teiti's voice was barely audible now. She did not raise it.

"For these, I can only say what we know."

"A welder. Filipino or Indonesian. Disappeared in 2054 after filing a safety complaint. Records list: contract terminated, departed. Family never contacted."

"A diver. I-Kiribati. Disappeared during a night dive in 2056. Body never recovered. No investigation conducted."

She did not have names for them. That was the horror.

"Two witnesses. Nationality unknown. Present during a material substitution incident. Reported inferior carbon fiber. Both disappeared within one week of each other."

"A doctor. Indian. She began documenting elevated cancer symptoms. She disappeared during a transfer to a ground facility. Never arrived."

"Four workers who had filed safety concerns in the months before Black Day. All disappeared. None listed among the Black Day dead."

She spoke them all. The photographer. The translator. The organizers. The engineer. The young man who asked too many questions. The woman who kept records.

"A worker. Lost. Unnamed by those who killed them."

She said it twenty-two times. Each time the same words. Each time a person erased.

When she finished, she was shaking. Her hands trembled against her thighs. Nei Teramoa in the front row had buried her face against another woman's shoulder.

---

Teiti waited for the shaking to pass. It did not pass entirely. She let it remain.

"There were other dead," she said. "The reef. The fish. The coral."

Her voice shifted. The rasp was still there, but something else came into it. A gentleness.

"When I was a girl, my grandfather took me to the Phoenix Islands. We sailed for two days. The water was so clear you could see thirty meters down. The fish were so thick you could walk on their backs. The coral was every color. Some of it had been growing since before the pyramids."

She paused. The room was utterly still.

"The Consortium needed the reef destroyed. The seabed scraped clean. I watched them do it."

She could not speak the names of the fish. The coral had no names. But they were dead.

"I speak for the water that is empty now. For the currents that have nothing to carry."

She was crying. She had not intended to cry. The tears floated free from her face, small spheres of salt water catching the dim light.

"The reef is dead. My husband is dead. My son is dead. I am here, speaking their names in a tower they were never allowed to enter."

She stopped.

The silence held.

---

After a long time, Teiti folded her hands.

Around her, the room remained frozen. People floated in place, gripping rails or each other, unsure how to move.

Yusuf Haddad pushed himself toward the door. He did not speak or look back. But as he passed, he reached out and touched Teiti's shoulder. A small pressure. An acknowledgment.

Others drifted away. Some whispered. Some did not speak at all. A few remained, eyes closed, absorbing what they had heard.

Teiti floated at the center of the empty chapel for a long time after the last person left. Her throat ached. Her voice was gone.

But the names had been spoken. In the place the dead had been denied.

The climber rose through the darkness. The hub glowed ahead. Teiti floated, empty and steady.
