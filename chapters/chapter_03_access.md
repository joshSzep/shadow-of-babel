# Chapter 3: Access

The city looked better from above.

Henrik watched Te Rarawa slide beneath the aircraft's wing, its concentric rings spreading outward from the tether like ripples frozen in glass and steel. The Ascension District blazed at the center—corporate towers catching the morning sun, the Grand Terminal's crystalline dome refracting light in calculated rainbows. Beautiful. The kind of beauty that photographed well, that translated cleanly into investor decks and promotional reels. The kind of beauty that meant someone had done their job correctly.

Beyond the inner rings, the light dimmed in predictable gradients. Service zones, worker housing, the sprawl. Henrik had seen the demographic reports, the population density maps, the carefully hedged assessments of "informal settlement challenges." He understood the city as a system—inputs and outputs, labor flows and capital allocation. From this altitude, it all made sense. The tether rose from the center like a needle threading Earth to heaven, and everything else was infrastructure in service of that singular purpose.

His father had shown him photographs of this place when it was still a construction platform, thirty years ago. A flat expanse of concrete and machinery rising from blue Pacific waters. "This is what vision looks like before it becomes real," Sven Lindqvist had said, his voice carrying the reverence he usually reserved for quarterly projections that exceeded forecast. "Someone looked at empty ocean and saw the future."

Henrik had been fourteen, already being groomed for succession, already learning to see the world as his father saw it: a series of opportunities waiting to be optimized. Now he was forty-four, the platform had become a city of three million, the empty ocean had become the most valuable real estate on Earth, and he was descending toward it in an aircraft that cost more than most of those three million would earn in their lifetimes.

The thought arrived without judgment. Simply a fact, like the altitude reading on the cabin display. Henrik had learned long ago that guilt was an inefficient emotion—resources consumed without returns. Better to focus on what could be done, what was being done, the genuine good that flowed from enterprise and ambition.

Lindqvist Orbital held seventeen percent of the elevator's cargo contracts. His company had manufactured thirty-two percent of the climber's composite panels. The solar arrays powering the orbital hub's life support bore his family's name on licensing agreements that would generate revenue for generations. If the elevator was humanity's ladder to the stars, the Lindqvist family had helped build the rungs.

That was legacy. That was contribution. Worth more than hand-wringing over inequality statistics.

"We're beginning our descent, Mr. Lindqvist." The pilot's voice came through the cabin speaker, professionally warm. "VIP terminal approach in twelve minutes. The advance team confirms everything is prepared."

"Thank you, Captain." Henrik straightened his cuffs—a habit, like checking his reflection, like the small adjustments that maintained the image. The suit was Italian, charcoal gray, cut to suggest authority without ostentation. His father had taught him that too: true wealth didn't announce itself. It simply occupied space with the confidence of belonging.

Across the cabin, Anna Bergström looked up from her tablet, her expression carrying the particular alertness of someone tracking multiple variables simultaneously. His chief of staff had been with him for six years—long enough to anticipate his needs, to smooth the thousand small frictions that leadership attracted. She was thirty-six, precise, and saw him more clearly than he sometimes preferred.

"The press schedule is confirmed," she said. "Arrival remarks at the terminal, then the photo opportunity with the scholarship cohort at eleven. Director Nakamura's office has requested a brief meeting before boarding—nothing urgent, they say, but the Chairman will be present."

"Kenji's making time for me?" Henrik allowed himself a small smile. "I'm touched."

"You're an investor. He's performing investor relations."

"Anna. So cynical."

"Realistic." She returned to her tablet. "Erik wants to discuss the Hashimoto proposal before tonight's reception. He has concerns about the equity structure."

Henrik nodded, his mind already shifting to the negotiation ahead. Yuki Hashimoto had been circling Lindqvist Orbital for two years, probing for partnership opportunities, testing boundaries. The maiden voyage was neutral ground for conversations that might reshape the orbital manufacturing landscape. Three hundred passengers from the industry's upper echelons, sealed in a climbing vessel for a week, with nothing to do but drink and deal.

Not that Henrik needed to justify the trip. He was here because he'd earned the right to be here—through work, through investment, through the accumulated weight of decisions that had built something lasting. The first investors had risked fortunes on an engineering dream. Now that dream was carrying passengers to orbit, and those early believers deserved their seats.

Through the window, the tether grew larger as they descended—a thread becoming a ribbon becoming a wall of woven carbon, impossibly tall, impossibly stable. Henrik had seen the engineering specifications, understood the mathematics of tension and counterweight, knew exactly how many patents his company held on the composite materials that made it possible. But understanding and *seeing* were different things. The structure was beautiful in a way that transcended its function, like a cathedral or a suspension bridge or any monument to human ambition that outlived the small concerns of its makers.

He felt something stir in his chest—pride, perhaps, or something adjacent to awe. He let himself feel it. Moments like this were rare.

---

The VIP terminal was a masterpiece of managed experience.

Henrik stepped from the aircraft into climate-controlled air, the Pacific heat sealed away behind smart glass that tinted automatically against the equatorial sun. The architecture soared—vaulted ceilings of carbon composite, living walls breathing oxygen into the filtered atmosphere, floors of polished stone reflecting soft light in pools of warmth. Everything designed to convey arrival, to mark the transition from ordinary world to extraordinary journey.

A delegation waited at the bottom of the aircraft stairs: Consortium officials in dark suits, his own advance team, faces he recognized from previous summits. Handshakes, greetings, the ritual of welcome. Henrik moved through it with practiced ease, distributing attention like a resource—a moment of eye contact here, a personal word there, the small investments that maintained relationships.

"Mr. Lindqvist." A young woman in Consortium livery approached with a tablet. "Welcome to Te Rarawa. If you'll follow me, we have your credentials prepared in the executive lounge."

He followed, Anna and Erik falling into step behind him. The terminal's interior unfolded in a sequence of carefully designed spaces—check-in areas for other passengers visible through glass walls, their queues orderly but present, a reminder that access was graduated. Henrik's path bypassed all of it, moving through corridors that existed specifically to separate certain passengers from others.

Not separation, he corrected himself. *Efficiency*. VIP processing required different infrastructure, different protocols. The gates weren't barriers; they were optimization.

"The press pool is assembled in the Horizon Lounge," the escort said. "Your prepared remarks have been loaded to the teleprompter. Director Nakamura's office suggests keeping questions to ten minutes."

"I'm comfortable extending if the questions are interesting."

"I'll inform them." The young woman's expression didn't change, but Henrik caught something—a flicker of assessment, quickly masked. She was good at her job. Everyone here was.

---

The press conference was a performance, and Henrik performed well.

He stood at a podium backed by windows, the tether visible behind him like a divine endorsement. Cameras captured the image—the successful industrialist, the forward-thinking investor, the face of private enterprise's role in humanity's greatest achievement. He delivered his remarks with the ease of long practice: the historic nature of the maiden voyage, the partnership between public vision and private initiative, the bright future awaiting those bold enough to reach for it.

The questions were predictable. The Hashimoto negotiations (no comment on ongoing discussions), the scholarship program (proud to support the next generation), his expectations for the voyage (anticipation, excitement, humility before the achievement). He answered them all with variations on themes he'd polished over years of interviews, giving journalists what they needed without giving them anything they could use.

One question, near the end, landed differently.

"Mr. Lindqvist." A woman in the second row, her press credentials identifying her as Global News Alliance. Sharp eyes, close-cropped hair, a stillness that suggested she was listening for what wasn't said. "The workers who built this elevator were promised passage that many never received. How do you respond to criticism that the maiden voyage prioritizes wealth over the workers' contribution?"

Henrik felt the slight shift in the room—attention sharpening, cameras adjusting. A trap question, designed to produce either callousness or defensive platitudes.

"I'd respond that the criticism misunderstands what this voyage represents," he said, voice measured, reasonable. "Fifty workers are aboard through the Builders' Union allocation. The lottery system has opened hundreds of seats to the global public. This isn't wealth versus workers—it's the beginning of access that will only expand. Every great technology starts expensive and becomes universal. That's the arc of progress."

"And the workers who didn't receive passage? The promises made during construction?"

"I can't speak to decisions made before my time." The answer came smoothly, deflection dressed as humility. "What I can speak to is the future we're building—a future where orbital access becomes as common as air travel. That's what the investment community is working toward. That's what today represents."

The journalist—Amara, he would learn later, though the name wouldn't register as significant yet—held his gaze a moment longer than comfortable. Then she nodded, and the moderator called for the next question, and the moment passed.

But Henrik noticed that she wrote something in her notebook rather than her tablet. Old-fashioned. Intentional. The observation filed itself away.

---

The photo opportunity with the scholarship students was easier.

Twelve young people arranged on risers, diverse and photogenic, wearing the eager expressions of those who'd won a lottery more exclusive than any public drawing. The Stellar Foundation scholarship program—funded by orbital industry partners, including Lindqvist Orbital—selected promising students from around the world for orbital studies and, the crown jewel, passage on the maiden voyage.

Henrik worked the line, shaking hands, learning names, asking about research interests. He was genuinely curious—or at least, genuinely capable of performing curiosity that felt genuine. These students represented the future workforce, the next generation of engineers and scientists who would build what his generation had imagined. Some might work for his company someday. Some might found companies that competed with his. Either way, they were investments.

One student caught his attention. A young woman, British accent, mixed heritage, wire-frame glasses and natural hair twisted into practical braids. She answered his questions about her research—orbital mechanics, tether dynamics—with a precision that suggested she was explaining things she could explain far more deeply if given the chance.

"Zara Chen-Okafor," she said when he asked her name. "Imperial College."

"The Chen-Okafor paper on oscillation dampening." He'd actually read it—or read the summary his technical team had prepared. "Impressive work for a graduate student."

Something flickered in her expression. Surprise, perhaps, that he'd recognized her name. Or something else—a wariness that seemed out of place amid the orchestrated warmth.

"Thank you, Mr. Lindqvist. The scholarship made it possible."

"That's what it's for." He smiled, the practiced smile that reached his eyes because he'd trained it to. "Making the impossible possible. That's what all of this is about."

She returned the smile, but her eyes stayed watchful. Assessing. Henrik filed that away—another pattern, another data point. The students weren't all the same. Some of them were performing as much as he was.

The photo session concluded with a group shot: Henrik in the center, scholarship students arranged around him, the tether visible through the windows behind them all. The image would appear in promotional materials for years, proof that the elevator lifted everyone, that opportunity ascended without discrimination.

Henrik held his smile until the cameras stopped clicking.

The executive lounge existed in a dimension adjacent to the rest of the terminal.

The same windows offered the same view of the tether, but here the crowds were absent, replaced by the particular quiet of spaces designed for those who didn't wait. Henrik settled into a leather chair that probably cost more than a lottery ticket, accepting the drink that appeared without his having ordered it—single malt, eighteen years, served in crystal that caught the filtered sunlight.

Erik Holmgren sat across from him, tablet propped on the armrest, numbers scrolling across the screen. His CFO's expression carried the particular tightness it developed when projections encountered inconvenient realities.

"The Hashimoto equity structure is aggressive," Erik said without preamble. "They want thirty percent of the manufacturing subsidiary for what amounts to technology access and distribution rights in the Japanese market."

"What do we want?"

"Twenty percent. With a sunset clause on the distribution exclusivity."

"What will we settle for?"

Erik's jaw tightened. "Twenty-five, probably. If we can negotiate the sunset clause down to ten years instead of fifteen."

"Then we'll start at eighteen and let them feel like they've won something." Henrik sipped his whisky. "Yuki respects negotiation. She'd be disappointed if we made it too easy."

"You're assuming she's negotiating in good faith."

"I'm assuming she's negotiating in *her* faith. That's all anyone does." He set the glass down. "The voyage gives us seven days of face time. More than we'd get in six months of formal meetings. Use it."

Erik nodded, making notes. He'd argue more later, in private, where disagreement was productive rather than undermining. That was their bargain: absolute candor in planning, absolute unity in execution.

Anna appeared at Henrik's elbow. "Director Nakamura's aide is here. They're ready."

"Then so am I." Henrik rose, adjusting his jacket. "Erik, the preliminary analysis on the Tiangong offer?"

"On your secure tablet. I wouldn't recommend discussing it with Lin directly until—"

"I'm not discussing. I'm listening." He smiled. "Different skill entirely."

The Nakamura meeting awaited—Chairman Murakami's proxy, feeling out the investors before the voyage began. Politics layered over commerce layered over engineering. Henrik moved toward the conference room, his stride unhurried, his mind already two steps ahead.

This was his world. He'd been raised to navigate it, trained to excel within it, rewarded for mastering its rules. The doubts that sometimes surfaced in quiet moments—questions about what the mastery cost, what it excluded—those were inefficiencies. He'd learned to redirect the energy they consumed toward productive channels.

The elevator was carrying him toward orbit. Everything else was below.

---

The meeting with Nakamura was brief and ceremonial—welcomes, assurances, the social lubrication that preceded serious negotiation. Henrik played his part, offered the expected compliments, accepted the expected courtesies. Kenji Murakami was not present after all; a scheduling conflict, Nakamura explained with the smooth regret of someone who'd invented the conflict himself.

Henrik understood. He would have done the same.

Afterward, Anna guided him through the final security protocols—biometric scans, credential verification, the invasive but necessary measures that kept the elevator safe. Henrik submitted to each procedure with patient tolerance. Security was a cost of doing business in a world where symbols attracted violence.

And the elevator was nothing if not symbolic. The longest structure ever built. The first permanent link between Earth and orbit. The physical manifestation of human ambition, rising from the Pacific like a prayer translated into carbon fiber. Every terrorist, every extremist, every desperate soul seeking to make a statement—they all looked at the tether and saw a target.

The final corridor led to the boarding gate—a threshold marked by subtle changes in lighting, in flooring, in the quality of air itself. Beyond it, through reinforced glass, the climber waited.

Henrik paused.

He'd seen images, of course. Schematics, models, promotional renders. He knew the specifications by heart—two hundred meters tall, forty meters wide, fifteen thousand tonnes of passenger vessel designed to carry five hundred people from Earth to orbit over the course of a week. He knew that thirty-two percent of its composite panels bore his company's manufacturing signatures.

But knowing and seeing were different things.

The climber rose from its docking cradle like a monument given permission to move. Its curved hull caught the sunlight in ripples of silver and white, running lights pulsing in slow sequences along its length. Windows studded its surface—observation ports offering views that would shift from clouds to stars over the coming days. At its base, where vessel met tether, the grip mechanism waited in patient embrace, ready to begin the long pull upward.

It was beautiful. Genuinely, unexpectedly beautiful.

Henrik felt that stirring again—the thing adjacent to awe. Pride in what human beings could build. Wonder at the scale of the ambition. Something almost spiritual in the presence of an achievement that dwarfed individual contribution while being composed of nothing but individual contributions.

His father would have appreciated this moment. Sven Lindqvist, who had risked the family fortune on the Consortium's first bond offering, who had believed when belief was expensive—he would have stood here and seen everything he'd worked for justified. The elevator existed. The climber waited. The future was ascending, and the Lindqvist family had helped lift it.

For a moment, Henrik found himself thinking of his own children—Astrid and Erik, eleven and nine, probably asleep now in Stockholm, growing up in houses he owned but rarely visited. He wondered if they would stand here someday, if they would feel what he was feeling, if they would know that their father had been part of this. He wondered if they would care.

The thought surprised him. He let it pass.

"Mr. Lindqvist?" Anna's voice, gentle. "They're ready for boarding."

Henrik nodded, but didn't move. Not yet. He wanted to hold this moment a little longer—the last instant of standing on Earth, looking up at the vessel that would carry him away from it.

Then the moment passed, as moments did, and Henrik walked forward to board the climber.

---

The VIP entrance led to the upper decks, where architecture shifted from functional to luxurious. Henrik's suite occupied Level 15—not the highest tier, reserved for Consortium leadership and heads of state, but comfortable enough. A sitting area, a sleep chamber, a private bathroom with real water pressure, and most importantly, windows. Two observation ports that would show him Earth shrinking and stars emerging over the coming days.

A steward had already unpacked his luggage, arranging suits in the closet with the precision of someone trained to anticipate needs before they arose. A bottle of champagne sat in an ice bucket on the side table—complimentary, according to the card, with the Chairman's regards. Henrik noted the gesture without sentiment. Kenji Murakami distributed courtesies the way generals distributed medals: strategically, with an eye toward future returns.

He poured a glass anyway. The champagne was excellent.

Through the window, the tether stretched upward until it vanished into blue sky that would soon become black void. Below, the city sprawled in its concentric rings—the Ascension District bright, the outer zones dimmer, the patterns of inequality visible in the simple distribution of light. Henrik watched the view without really seeing it, his mind already moving to the negotiations ahead.

Somewhere below the boarding platform—not that he'd seen it, his path having diverged from those channels—the other passengers would be completing their own arrival rituals. The lottery winners with their nervous excitement, the workers with their quiet dignity, the politicians and journalists and scholarship students who made up the human tapestry of the maiden voyage. Five hundred people sealed into a vessel climbing toward the stars.

Henrik hoped they'd enjoy the view. The Consortium had invested significantly in the observation deck experience, and the revenue projections for orbital tourism depended on positive word-of-mouth from this first public voyage.

The thought arrived without irony. It was simply how his mind worked—translating experience into economics, wonder into market opportunity. If that was a limitation, it was also a strength. Someone had to think about sustainability, about the business models that would keep the elevator running for generations. Vision was beautiful, but vision without viability was dreaming.

His tablet chimed. A message from Erik: *Hashimoto's chief of staff wants to schedule a preliminary conversation. Tomorrow, 1600, Observation Lounge B. Confirm?*

Henrik typed a reply: *Confirmed. Order something expensive for the table. Let them know we're not worried.*

He set the tablet aside and returned to the window. In a few hours, the climber would begin its ascent. The terminal would fall away, the sky would darken, and Earth would become a marble hanging in endless black. Henrik would watch it happen while drinking champagne that cost more than some passengers earned in a month, and he would feel whatever he felt—awe, pride, the satisfaction of participation in something larger than himself.

And then he would return to his tablet, and his negotiations, and the careful management of interests that had consumed his life since before he understood he had a choice.

A soft chime sounded through the cabin—the preliminary departure announcement, welcoming passengers aboard, advising them to settle into their accommodations before launch. Henrik finished his champagne and poured another glass.

Through the window, the tether waited. Above it, orbit. Above that, stars.

Below, if he looked—which he didn't—the outer rings spread toward horizons he would never walk. The protests at checkpoints he'd bypassed, the workers who had built the elevator and watched others board it, the children growing up seeing the climber ascend and wondering if they would ever ride it—all of them existed in the same world he inhabited, but at an altitude he rarely visited.

Henrik Lindqvist, forty-four, CEO of Lindqvist Orbital Industries, heir to a fortune built on vision and timing and the accumulated advantages of starting ahead, settled into his suite and prepared for departure.

The future was ascending. He intended to be part of it.

What else was boarding—the ghosts and grievances, the witnesses and the wounded, the weight of promises broken and debts unpaid—that was below his notice. For now. The voyage was seven days long, and in the climber's sealed environment, paths would cross that never intersected on Earth.

Henrik didn't know this yet. He was thinking about equity structures and market access and the warm satisfaction of having arrived where he was always meant to be.

Outside his window, the tether rose like a thread connecting Earth to everything beyond it.

The climber hummed softly around him, preparing to climb.
