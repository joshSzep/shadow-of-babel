# Chapter 15: Below Decks

The mess hall on Level 2 was nothing like the VIP lounge sixteen decks above.

Yusuf stood at the entrance and let the sound wash over him: voices in a dozen languages, the clatter of metal trays, laughter that carried the particular edge of people who had stopped pretending. The air smelled of rice and spiced vegetables and the faint chemical undertone of the climber's recycling systems. No champagne here. No servers in pressed uniforms. Just tables bolted to the floor and people who knew what work looked like.

He felt his shoulders drop for the first time since boarding.

The observation deck had unsettled him—not the view, though the view had been its own kind of violence. What unsettled him was seeing *them*. The executives with their champagne flutes. Henrik Lindqvist moving through the crowd like he owned the air itself. And Kenji Murakami, scanning the dome with the particular intensity of a man looking for someone he didn't want to find.

Their eyes had met. Two seconds, maybe three. Long enough for recognition. Long enough for the question that had hung between them for nineteen years to grow teeth.

*Why did you send me the ticket?*

But that confrontation would come later. Tonight, Yusuf wanted something simpler. He wanted to be among people who knew what a load-bearing calculation felt like in their hands. Who had felt the vacuum through a pressure suit's skin. Who understood that every meter of the tether stretching above them represented someone's labor, someone's risk, someone's life.

He found an empty seat near the back and settled into it, feeling the slight vibration through the bench—the pulse of the electromagnetic drive, steady as a heartbeat. His body read the frequency automatically, decades of training processing what his conscious mind no longer needed to analyze. The climber was healthy. Rising smoothly. Doing exactly what it was designed to do.

*What we designed it to do*, he corrected himself. *What we built.*

---

Carlos Reyes appeared at his elbow ten minutes later, carrying two metal cups and the same battered flask from the night before.

"Haddad." He settled onto the bench with the careful movements of a man whose joints had been paying interest for years. "Figured you'd end up here eventually."

"Where else would I go?"

"Premium deck." Carlos's smile had edges. "I hear the wine list is public. Forty-year Bordeaux. Japanese whisky older than my son."

"You read the wine list?"

"Couldn't help myself." He poured arak into both cups, the anise sharp in the recycled air. "Spent ten minutes thinking about what I'd order if I could. Ten minutes imagining myself up there, drinking their wine, looking through their bigger windows." He laughed, but it was ugly. "What kind of man does that make me?"

"Human," Yusuf said. It was what he'd said last night, and it was still true.

They drank in silence for a moment, watching the mess hall fill. Economy passengers drifted in from the corridors—some still carrying the stunned expression of lottery winners who couldn't believe where they were, others with the worn edges of workers who knew exactly what this voyage meant and what it didn't.

Yusuf recognized a few faces from the boarding queue. The Ghanaian cocoa farmer, Kwame Agyei, who had stared at the tether like it was a beanstalk from a story his grandmother told. The Egyptian felucca sailor, Ahmed Hassan, who had navigated the Nile his whole life and was now rising above it. The Malian griot, Ousmane Diop, who had announced to the queue that he would tell this story to generations.

Lottery winners. People who had entered their names into a system that gave a hundred million applicants five hundred chances, and had somehow emerged on the winning side. They moved through the mess hall with a particular quality of wonder—not the smooth appreciation of the premium passengers, but something rawer. Something that knew how improbable their presence was.

And then there were the others. The worker compensation passengers. The ones whose tickets had been earned with blood and bone and years of promises deferred.

"There's Mohammad," Carlos said, nodding toward a table near the center.

Yusuf followed his gaze. Mohammad Ali sat alone, his food untouched, his eyes fixed on something no one else could see. He was one of the Black Day survivors—had been at 8,000 kilometers when the ribbon broke, had watched the recovery crews get swept away, had somehow made it to an evacuation pod while 847 of his colleagues died around him.

Twenty-three years later, and the man still looked like he was falling.

"Does he talk about it?" Yusuf asked.

"Never. Not once." Carlos took another drink. "But I've seen him at night, in the observation alcoves. Standing there for hours. Talking to someone who isn't there."

---

The I-Kiribati group had claimed a corner of the mess hall, their cluster of tables forming a small island of shared language and memory. Yusuf counted eleven of them—plus Mama Teiti, who sat at the center like a queen holding court, her white hair bright against the steel-gray walls.

The younger I-Kiribati deferred to her without seeming to think about it. They leaned in when she spoke, passed her food before she asked for it, made space for her gestures. She was telling a story, her hands moving through air, and even from across the room Yusuf could see the way her audience hung on each word.

"She's something," Carlos said, following his gaze. "Led a ceremony last night, I heard. Storage bay that the crew cleared out for them. Traditional songs, prayers, names of the dead. Someone said it went for hours."

Yusuf had heard about it too. The I-Kiribati gathering—*Te Rii ni Banaba*, they called their movement—had organized something outside the Consortium's managed schedule. Something real. Something that belonged to them.

"Remember when she shut down the anniversary ceremony in '75?" Carlos asked. "The one where they were going to dedicate the new memorial wall?"

Yusuf remembered. The Consortium had planned a grand event—dignitaries, cameras, speeches about sacrifice and progress. Mama Teiti had walked to the podium uninvited and started speaking names. Not just the 847 from Black Day, which the wall commemorated. All of them. The anchor collapse victims. The Twelve. The radiation dead. The workers who had simply vanished, their records conveniently lost.

She had spoken for forty minutes before security escorted her away. By then, half the dignitaries had left, and the cameras had captured every second.

"They tried to arrest her," Yusuf said. "Couldn't make the charges stick."

"What were they going to charge her with? Speaking the truth too loud?" Carlos shook his head. "She's been doing this for thirty years. They can't stop her. Can't buy her. Can't make her go away." He raised his cup slightly in Teiti's direction. "Mama Teiti. The conscience nobody asked for."

---

The debate started, as these things always did, with someone asking a question that had no good answer.

"So what are we, then?" The speaker was a man Yusuf didn't recognize—stocky, fifties, the particular compression of someone who'd spent years in pressure suits. His accent was Nigerian, his hands scarred in the pattern of electrical work. "Victory or surrender?"

The question rippled through the tables around him. Conversations paused. Heads turned.

"Victory," someone said from the lottery winner section. "We're here, aren't we? After everything, we're here."

"Are we?" The Nigerian—Blessing Okoro, Yusuf remembered now, a safety inspector who had documented hazards for years and been ignored for his trouble—leaned forward. "Fifty workers. Out of—what, hundreds of thousands? How many built this thing? How many are still down there right now, watching us rise on their screens, thinking—" He stopped, shook his head. "Fifty. They gave us fifty seats and called it justice."

"Fifty is more than zero." This from Tokintekai Bureieta, the union organizer from the I-Kiribati group. He had moved closer to the debate, leaving Teiti's circle but still within its gravity. "Fifty is a foot in the door."

"A foot in the door." Blessing's laugh was bitter. "That's what they said about the lottery. 'A foot in the door. A step toward access for all.' And now a hundred million people entered, and five hundred got seats, and we're supposed to celebrate?"

"What's the alternative?" someone else asked. "Stay on the ground? Refuse to go?"

"Some did refuse." This was a voice Yusuf hadn't expected—younger, sharper. He turned to see a man in his late twenties, lean and watchful, with the coiled energy of someone used to being hunted. "The Grounded. They say the whole project is wrong. Fix Earth before we flee it, all that."

"Are you Grounded?" Blessing asked.

The young man smiled, but it didn't reach his eyes. "I'm here, aren't I?"

"That's not an answer."

"Maybe there aren't—" He stopped. Started again. "Look, we built this tower on drowned islands and dead workers. That's done. It's built. So now we're riding it, and the only question is what we do with the ride. Whether we—" He trailed off, gestured vaguely at the walls around them. "I don't know. Make it mean something. Or don't."

The silence stretched. Yusuf felt the weight of it—the weight of a question that had no resolution, that had been asked in union halls and protest lines and quiet conversations for decades. Were they witnesses or collaborators? Victors or victims? Was accepting passage a triumph or a betrayal?

He thought of Fatima, watching the coverage from their small apartment. Of Omar's drawings, filling notebook after notebook with images of the tower his father had built. Of Nadia's questions, always questions, wanting to understand how things worked and why.

*Why are you going, Baba? What will you see?*

He hadn't known how to answer then. He still didn't.

---

"Reyes." The voice came from behind them, and Carlos turned. A woman had approached—Filipina, mid-fifties, with the particular grief of someone who had worn it so long it had become posture. "Carlos Reyes. From the Climber 17 memorial committee."

"Rosalinda." Carlos rose, took her hands. "I didn't know you were aboard."

"Worker compensation. Finally." Her smile was fragile. "Twenty years of fighting, and they give me a ticket on the maiden voyage. Like it's a gift."

"Your husband was—"

"Juanito." She said the name like a prayer. "Cruz. Third from the bottom of The Twelve. He'd been married three months when he died. Our daughter was three months old."

Yusuf felt something shift in his chest. The Twelve. He had painted their names on walls during the protests of '69, had said them so many times they'd worn grooves in his memory. But hearing about Juanito Cruz from his widow made the name mean something different. Not a martyr. A husband. A father who never got to be one.

"She's twenty now," Rosalinda continued. "My daughter. She wears his portrait on a pendant. She wanted to come with me, but—" She stopped. Swallowed. "One ticket. They gave me one ticket."

"I'm sorry," Carlos said. It was inadequate, but it was what there was.

"Don't be sorry. Be angry." Rosalinda's voice hardened. "I'm not here to forgive them. I'm not here to celebrate. I'm here because my husband helped build this thing, and he never got to ride it, and the least I can do is ride it for him."

She excused herself and moved toward the I-Kiribati corner, toward Mama Teiti. Yusuf watched her go and thought of all the others like her—the widows and widowers, the orphans and bereaved parents, carrying their dead into the sky.

1,247 names. That was what they said, what Teiti had made them acknowledge. 1,247 documented deaths, and probably more that had been swept into the category of "natural causes" or simply erased.

Five hundred passengers. Give or take. Yusuf did the math without meaning to—his mind always did math, always calculated loads and tolerances and what things could bear. More than two dead for every living soul aboard. Two and a half, almost. The ratio sat in his chest like a stone.

*We're riding a funeral procession*, he thought. *And they're calling it a celebration.*

---

"You're quiet tonight."

Yusuf looked up. Carlos had refilled their cups at some point, and the mess hall had grown louder around them—more arguments, more laughter, the particular intensity of people processing something too large to hold.

"I'm thinking."

"About what?"

"About who's watching us." Yusuf took a slow drink, feeling the arak's burn. "The view deck today. I saw the Chairman."

Carlos went still. "Murakami?"

"He was scanning the crowd. Looking for someone." Yusuf set down his cup. "Someone saw him later, one of the crew. Said he was at an observation alcove at two in the morning. Just standing there. Looking for someone."

"Looking for who?"

Yusuf didn't answer. He didn't have to.

The ticket had arrived three weeks before departure. No note. No explanation. Just passage on the maiden voyage, allocated from the Chairman's discretionary reserve. Yusuf had known immediately who sent it—there was only one person who would, only one person who had reason to.

Nineteen years ago, Yusuf had pulled Kenji Murakami from wreckage during a site inspection gone wrong. Had spent four hours trapped with him while rescue crews cut through debris. Had shown him the reality of construction conditions—the shortcuts, the broken equipment, the exhaustion that killed as surely as decompression.

Kenji had promised to fix it. Had meant it, Yusuf was certain. Had fought for better conditions when he returned to Earth, had won some battles, had lost the war.

And then he had risen. Deputy Director. Executive Vice President. Chairman of the Babel Consortium. The face of the institution that had betrayed every promise made to workers like Yusuf.

The ticket was—what? An apology? An acknowledgment? A summons to judgment?

"He sent it," Yusuf said quietly. "Murakami. The ticket. He sent it without a word."

Carlos was silent for a long moment. "And you took it."

"I took it."

"Why?"

Yusuf thought of Miriam Okonkwo, standing at the observation deck, looking at the Pacific. He had seen her face—the complex architecture of guilt and pride and something else he couldn't name. The architect. The woman who had made it all possible. The woman who had known, must have known, what her calculations would cost.

He thought of Kenji, scanning the crowd, looking for the man he had abandoned.

He thought of the tether above them, stretching toward stars he had once hoped to see.

"Because I want to understand," he said finally. "What it meant. What I built. What they did with it." He picked up his cup, found it empty, set it down again. "And because they owe me this much. This one ride. After everything."

---

The name dropped into conversation like a stone into still water.

"The architect's aboard, you know."

Yusuf's hand froze halfway to the flask.

"Okonkwo." The speaker was Indra Wibowo—Indonesian, brother of one of The Twelve. He had the particular bitterness of someone who had spent twenty years seeking justice and finding only paperwork. "I saw her at the observation deck. Standing there, looking at what she built."

"She solved the oscillation problem," someone said. "Made the whole thing stable."

"She also signed off on the safety protocols." Indra's voice was flat. "The ones that were supposed to protect my brother. The ones that failed."

The mess hall had gone quiet around them. Even the lottery winners had stopped their excited conversations, sensing something in the air—the particular tension that preceded either violence or truth.

"What do you want her to do?" This from Tokintekai, the union organizer. "Apologize? Would that bring anyone back?"

"No." Indra shook his head. "But it would mean something. It would mean she saw us. Saw what her equations cost."

"You think she doesn't see it?" The voice came from the I-Kiribati corner, and everyone turned.

Mama Teiti had risen. She moved through the tables with the particular grace of someone who had spent decades navigating difficult spaces—construction sites and board rooms and protests that could turn violent without warning. The crowd parted for her without being asked.

"The architect carries her own weight," Teiti said. "I watched her today, at the observation deck. She was looking at the Pacific. Searching for something that isn't there anymore."

"The reef?" someone asked.

"The reef. The islands. Everything they buried to build this city." Teiti stopped at the center of the room, and her presence seemed to expand to fill it. "She knows. She knew when she designed it. The question is not whether she sees—it's what she's willing to do with what she sees."

"And what's that?" Indra asked. "What could she possibly do now?"

Teiti was quiet for a moment. Her eyes found Yusuf's across the room, and something passed between them—recognition, perhaps. Solidarity. The shared weight of people who had built something that had also built their grief.

"Witness," she said. "Acknowledge. Speak truth when they want her to speak triumph." She let the word hang. "That's what any of us can do. That's why we're here."

She turned and walked back toward her corner, and the conversations resumed around her—quieter now, more thoughtful. The debate about victory and surrender continued, but something had shifted. A question had been asked that might not have a good answer, but at least now it was being asked.

Yusuf sat with Carlos's arak warming his stomach and watched Teiti settle back among her people. She was right, he knew. About the architect, about witnessing, about the weight they all carried.

He would find Miriam Okonkwo. Not tonight—tonight was for processing, for being among people who understood. But soon. He would find her, and he would make her see. Not with rage, though the rage was there, fuel for a lifetime of burning. With something else. With the kind of truth that couldn't be deflected or managed or bought off.

*Did you know?* That was the question. *When you drew your beautiful equations, when you solved your elegant problems—did you know what it would cost?*

He suspected she had. He suspected that was exactly why she was here, riding the structure of her own creation, looking for the reef that wasn't there anymore.

The reckoning was coming. For all of them.

---

The mess hall emptied slowly, passengers drifting toward their dormitories as the artificial night deepened. The arguments had burned themselves out, leaving the particular quiet of people who had said everything they could say and still hadn't found resolution.

Yusuf stayed until the end, listening to the last conversations, watching the servers clear the tables. They were workers too, he realized—crew members whose contracts bound them to service rather than celebration. They moved through the space efficiently, professionally, invisible the way workers always became invisible.

He caught one of their eyes—a young woman, South Asian, maybe thirty. She paused in her work, surprised to be seen.

"Thank you," he said.

She nodded once, uncertain how to respond, and moved on.

Carlos had left an hour ago, claiming his arthritic joints needed the bunks. The I-Kiribati had departed in a group, Teiti at their center, her presence gathering them like a moon gathering tides. Most of the worker compensation passengers had dispersed to their dormitories, carrying their stories and their dead with them.

Now Yusuf sat alone, feeling the vibration through the bench—the pulse of the drive, steady as a heartbeat, carrying them higher.

Above him, sixteen decks away, the premium passengers were probably sleeping in beds that cost more than his annual salary. Henrik Lindqvist was dreaming of deals. Kenji Murakami was lying awake, rehearsing apologies he would never deliver.

And somewhere between them, in a cabin she had earned with mathematics that had changed the world, Miriam Okonkwo was carrying her own weight of knowledge.

*I'll find you*, Yusuf thought. *I'll make you see what your equations cost. And then we'll both have to live with what we know.*

He rose, his knees protesting after hours of sitting, and made his way toward the dormitories. The corridors were quiet now, lit with the dim emergency lighting of shipboard night. His footsteps echoed on the composite floor.

At a junction, he paused. Through a small observation port—nothing like the grand dome above, just a circle of transparency barely wider than his hand—he could see Earth.

It was smaller now. Noticeably smaller. The blue marble that contained everything he loved, shrinking behind him as the climber rose.

Fatima was down there somewhere, watching the coverage, carrying her own weight of waiting. The children were asleep, or should be, dreaming of the stars their father had promised to draw for them.

*I'm here*, he thought at them. *I'm rising. And I'm carrying you with me.*

He pressed his palm to the port, feeling the cold of space through the composite, and let himself look at the home he was leaving behind.

Tomorrow there would be more debates. More stories. More reckoning to come. The architect was aboard, and the Chairman was searching for him, and the whole weight of Babel's history was ascending toward a judgment that might never arrive.

But tonight, just for a moment, Yusuf Haddad stood in a corridor of the structure he had built, watching the world turn below him, and let himself feel something that was not quite rage.

Something that might, in another context, be called wonder.

The stars burned steadily outside the port, indifferent to human calculation. The tether stretched above him toward destinations he had only dreamed of. And the climber rose, patient and relentless, carrying its five hundred passengers through the dark.

Workers and executives. Lottery winners and compensation cases. The living and the dead they carried with them.

All of them rising.

All of them waiting to see what they would find at the top.
