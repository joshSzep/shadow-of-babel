# Chapter 23: The Real Story

The service corridor on Level 4 was not supposed to be accessible to press.

Amara had learned this the way she learned most useful things: by walking where she wasn't invited and seeing who stopped her. The answer, at 0630 ship time on Day 3, was no one. The corridor was narrow, utilitarian, lined with pipes and conduits that the passenger areas hid behind polished panels. It smelled of recycled air and something else—machine oil, perhaps, or the particular staleness of spaces designed for function rather than comfort.

She moved carefully, her tablet tucked under her arm, her recorder a weight in her pocket.

The corridor ended at a junction. Left led to the cargo holds and engineering spaces—restricted, monitored, beyond her current ambitions. Right led to the Economy Deck common areas. The workers' section.

She turned right.

---

The mess hall on Level 2 was different at dawn than it would be at midday.

Amara stood in the entrance, letting her eyes adjust to the amber lighting, cataloging the space the way she cataloged all spaces: exits, sight lines, who was present, who was watching. Perhaps thirty people scattered across the bolted-down tables. Some eating—the breakfast service had begun, steam rising from metal serving stations. Others nursing cups of tea or coffee, the particular stillness of people who had not yet decided what the day would require of them.

No one looked up when she entered. That itself was information. In the VIP lounge, her press credentials drew attention—wary, calculating, the awareness of people who understood that observation could become narrative. Here, she was invisible. Press was not expected. Press was not relevant. The people in this room had stopped believing that their stories would be told.

She chose a table near the wall, where she could see the room without being at its center. A server appeared—young, South Asian, her nameplate reading PATEL—and Amara ordered tea. The server's eyes flickered to the press badge on Amara's lanyard, then away. No comment. No question. Just the tea, delivered in a metal cup that matched the ones on every other table.

Amara wrapped her hands around the cup and waited.

---

The first interview found her.

"You're the journalist." The voice came from her left—a woman, perhaps mid-fifties, settling into the chair across the table without asking permission. Filipino, her face carrying the particular grief of someone who had learned to wear it like clothing. "Diallo. Global News Alliance. I saw you at boarding."

Amara set down her cup. "You have a good memory for faces."

"I have a good memory for everyone who might tell my husband's story." The woman extended her hand. "Rosalinda Cruz."

The name landed with weight. Amara knew it—had known it before boarding, had flagged it in her research files. Wife of Juanito Cruz, one of the Twelve. Climber 17. March 15, 2068.

"I'm sorry for your loss," Amara said. The words were inadequate. They were always inadequate. But they were the door through which harder conversations could pass.

"Twenty years." Rosalinda's hand was still extended. Amara took it. The grip was firm, brief, the handshake of someone who had learned to meet strangers without flinching. "Twenty years of being sorry. Twenty years of settlements and non-disclosure agreements and 'we regret to inform you.' And now I'm here. Riding the thing that killed him."

"Why did you come?"

Rosalinda's laugh was sharp, humorless. "Because they finally offered. Because my daughter couldn't come, and someone from our family should see what Juanito died for. Because—" She stopped. Her eyes went to the viewport at the far end of the mess hall, where Earth hung blue and distant in the frame. "Because I wanted to understand what he saw. At the end. When the climber was falling and he knew he wouldn't survive. I wanted to see what he was looking at."

Amara reached for her tablet, slowly, giving Rosalinda time to object. "May I record this?"

"Will you use it?"

"I don't know yet." Honesty. It was the only currency that worked in conversations like this. "I'm trying to understand the pattern. The system. What happened to your husband, and to others. Whether there's a story I can tell that matters."

Rosalinda studied her for a long moment. Then she nodded.

"Record. I'll tell you about Juanito."

---

The story came in fragments, the way stories of the dead always came—not chronological, not complete, but circling around the absence at their center.

Juanito Cruz had been twenty-six when he died. Married three months. His daughter—the daughter Rosalinda had been carrying when the news came—was now twenty years old, studying engineering at the University of the Philippines. She wore her father's portrait on a pendant. She had never seen him except in photographs.

He had been a drive systems technician. Specialized, skilled, recruited from a technical institute in Manila with promises of passage and prosperity. The Consortium had paid for his training. The Consortium had assigned him to Climber 17, the bootstrap vessel that carried repair materials to the upper sections during the Thickening phase.

"He loved it," Rosalinda said. Her voice had steadied, settling into the rhythm of a story told many times. "The work. The view. He would send me videos—Earth from the observation ports, the stars at night. He said it was like being inside a cathedral. Like touching something holy."

"What happened to Climber 17?"

Rosalinda's hands tightened around her cup. "Drive failure. At 12,000 kilometers. The emergency descent systems engaged, but they weren't—" She stopped. Drew breath. "The investigation said the systems were within operational parameters. That the failure was an unpredictable cascade. That no one was at fault."

"But?"

"But the workers had been reporting anomalies for weeks. Vibrations in the drive housing. Hesitation in the electromagnetic engagement. Juanito filed three separate maintenance requests. All three were classified as 'non-critical' and deferred."

Amara wrote the words in her tablet, though she didn't need to. She would remember them. She remembered all of it—the details that accumulated, year after year, story after story, until the pattern became undeniable.

"The climber fell for forty-seven minutes," Rosalinda continued. "The recovery systems finally caught it, but by then—" She shook her head. "Forty-seven minutes. That's how long my husband had to know he was going to die. Forty-seven minutes of falling through the dark, waiting for the systems to save him or not save him, watching Earth get closer and knowing—"

She couldn't finish. Amara didn't ask her to.

"The settlement," Rosalinda said after a moment. "The settlement included a non-disclosure clause. I wasn't supposed to talk about the maintenance reports. The deferred requests. The things Juanito told me in his last messages." Her voice hardened. "I signed because I had a baby and no money and no way to fight them. But the clause had a twenty-year expiration. It expired last March."

"And now you're talking."

"Now I'm talking." Rosalinda looked at her—direct, unflinching, the gaze of someone who had spent two decades waiting for this moment. "Are you listening?"

---

The second interview came an hour later.

Mohammad Ali sat alone at a corner table, his food untouched, his eyes fixed on something no one else could see. Amara had noticed him when she entered—the particular stillness, the thousand-yard stare that she recognized from conflict zones, from refugee camps, from anywhere that trauma had taken root and refused to leave.

She approached carefully, pulling a chair to a respectful distance rather than sitting across from him. In her experience, survivors of catastrophe needed space. They needed the option to look away.

"Mr. Ali." She kept her voice soft. "I'm Amara Diallo. I'm a journalist."

He didn't respond immediately. His eyes moved to her face, then past her, then back. Focusing and unfocusing, like a camera struggling to find its subject.

"I know who you are," he said finally. His voice was rough, accented—Bangladeshi, she thought. "I saw you at the memorial ceremony. In Te Rarawa. Three years ago."

Amara searched her memory. The Black Day anniversary. The twenty-first. She had covered the official ceremony—the speeches, the wreath-laying, the Consortium representatives with their carefully managed grief—and then, afterward, the workers' gathering at the Shadow Memorial. The real ceremony, the one without cameras.

"You were there," she said. "At the Shadow Memorial."

"I'm always there." Mohammad's hands trembled slightly around his cup. "Every year. I'm always there because I'm the one who got out. I'm the one who lived."

"Black Day."

"September 14, 2062." The date came without hesitation—a number carved into him, part of his operating system. "I was at 8,200 kilometers. Maintenance crew. We were doing splice inspection when the ribbon broke."

Amara waited. She had learned that some stories couldn't be prompted. They had to be offered, or not at all.

"The break was above us," Mohammad continued. "At maybe 8,500. We heard it—not heard, felt. A vibration that shouldn't exist. The tether screaming. And then—" He stopped. His hands were shaking badly now. "The lower section whipped. Like a snake. Like something alive, trying to throw us off. I was clipped to a maintenance frame. My partner wasn't. His clip had malfunctioned—he'd reported it the day before, they said the replacement parts were backordered—"

He couldn't continue. Amara didn't ask him to.

"847," Mohammad said after a long silence. "That's the official number. 847 names on the wall. But there were more. People who died later, from injuries. People who died of the cancers, the radiation exposure the Consortium denied. People who—" He shook his head. "I go to the memorial every year. I stand there and I count the names. And I know the count is wrong."

"How wrong?"

Mohammad finally looked at her directly. His eyes were wet, but his voice was steady now, settling into the terrible clarity of testimony.

"I knew eleven of the 847 personally. Worked with them. Ate with them. Sent money home to the same villages." He held up his hands, the trembling visible. "Eleven friends. And that was just my crew, my section, my corner of the project. Multiply that across every crew, every section, every family—"

He let the calculation hang in the air. Amara didn't need to complete it.

"The Consortium paid for my treatment," Mohammad said. "For the PTSD. The therapy. The medication that helps me sleep sometimes. They paid for all of it, and all they asked was that I sign a paper saying I was satisfied with the resolution." His laugh was hollow. "Satisfied. They killed 847 of my friends and they asked if I was *satisfied*."

"Did you sign?"

"I signed." The words were flat, exhausted. "I signed because I needed the treatment. Because my wife needed me alive. Because fighting them would have taken years and money I didn't have, and they knew it, and they designed the choice so that signing was the only rational option." He looked at his trembling hands. "That's how they work. They make the betrayal the logical choice. They make you complicit in your own silencing."

Amara wrote it down. The pattern. The system. The architecture of complicity that made fighting impossible and collaboration inevitable.

And even as she wrote, she felt the familiar calculation beginning—how to frame this, which quotes would survive the edit, whether Mohammad's trembling hands would translate to video or require description. She hated herself for it. The man was bleeding in front of her and some part of her brain was already composing the lede.

"Will you use this?" Mohammad asked.

"I'm not ready to answer that," she said. Honesty, but also evasion. She wasn't sure which was winning.

"Use it," Mohammad said. "Even if they destroy you for it. Use it. Someone should know what we paid. Someone should count the real number."

---

The third interview she had to work for.

Blessing Okoro was harder to approach. The Nigerian safety inspector had a reputation—Amara had heard it in the mess hall conversations, the whispered assessments of who was aboard and why. *He documented everything. Filed reports for years. They ignored him until people died, and then they blamed him for not filing the reports correctly.*

He sat alone at a table near the service corridor, his back to the wall, his eyes tracking everyone who entered and left. When Amara approached, he watched her come with the particular attention of someone who had learned that observers could be dangerous.

"Mr. Okoro." She stopped at arm's length, not presuming to sit. "I'm—"

"I know who you are." His voice was clipped, professional. "I read your coverage of the 2082 radiation disclosure. The follow-up on the Orbital Workers' Collective. The piece on the return fare fight."

"You've done your research."

"I research everyone who might be researching me." He gestured to the chair across from him—not an invitation, more of an acknowledgment that she would sit regardless. "The press is not usually interested in safety inspectors. We're not dramatic. We're just the ones who write the reports that no one reads."

Amara sat. "Your reports were read. Eventually."

"Eventually." The word carried decades of bitterness. "After Climber 17. After Black Day. After the radiation numbers leaked. Then suddenly everyone wanted to see the reports I'd been filing for years—the ones that had been classified as 'not actionable' or 'outside operational parameters' or 'requiring further review.'"

"What did the reports say?"

Blessing was quiet for a moment. His hands, Amara noticed, were scarred—small burns and cuts, the accumulated damage of years working with electrical systems in conditions that didn't allow for proper protection.

"The reports said what I saw," he said finally. "Splice junctions with micro-fractures that needed reinforcement. Drive systems operating at margins that were technically acceptable but practically dangerous. Radiation shielding that met specifications written twenty years before the actual construction conditions were understood." He shook his head. "I filed 423 reports over eight years. I have copies of all of them. The Consortium has copies of all of them. And 847 people are dead."

"Did the reports contribute to any changes?"

"Some. After people died." His voice was flat. "That's how it works. You file a report saying something is dangerous. They classify it as non-critical because fixing it would cost money and delay the schedule. People die. Then they fix it, because now the liability calculation has changed—the lawsuits cost more than the repairs would have. And they send someone to tell you that your concerns have been addressed, as if the addressing didn't require blood."

Amara felt the familiar weight settling into her chest—the weight of stories that accumulated, year after year, until they became something she couldn't set down.

"Why did you stay?" she asked. "After all of that. Why did you keep filing reports?"

Blessing looked at her. His expression shifted—something complex moving beneath the professional surface, something that might have been grief or rage or the exhausted residue of both.

"Because someone had to," he said. "Because if I stopped documenting, they would say there were no problems. Because the reports were—" He stopped. Drew breath. "The reports were my witness. My testimony. A timestamped file nobody could claim they never received. That when the next disaster came, no one could say we didn't know."

"And the next disaster came."

"The next disaster always comes." His voice was quiet now, almost gentle. "That's what I learned. In this system, the next disaster always comes, because preventing disasters costs money and the people who control the money don't die in the disasters. They pay settlements. They sign accords. They make speeches about lessons learned. And then they keep running the same calculations—acceptable risk, acceptable loss, acceptable sacrifice—because the calculations keep working for them."

Amara's recorder was running in her pocket. She hadn't asked permission. She would ask later, before she used anything. But she needed the words captured, the cadence preserved, the particular weight of testimony spoken by someone who had carried it for decades.

Even her ethics had an edit queue.

"What do you want?" she asked. "From this voyage. From this conversation. What are you hoping happens?"

Blessing considered the question. His eyes went to the viewport, to the Earth that hung distant and blue in the frame.

"I want to see it from the top," he said. "The structure I spent my life trying to make safe. I want to stand at the orbital hub and look back at what we built—what we really built, all of it, the wonder and the cost." He paused. "And I want someone to tell the truth. Not the Consortium's truth. Not the careful narrative they've been managing for forty years. The real story. What it cost. What it's still costing. Who paid."

"That's a dangerous story to tell."

"I know." He looked at her directly. "Are you going to tell it?"

Amara met his gaze. The question had been building for hours, for days, for the eight years she had spent circling this story without ever quite grasping it.

"I don't trust my answer yet," she said. "I'm trying to understand it first."

"Understand it better," Blessing said. "And faster. Because the longer you wait, the easier it becomes to not tell it at all."

A chime sounded overhead. "Attention passengers. The observation deck will close for maintenance in thirty minutes. Standard viewing will resume at fourteen hundred hours."

The ship, reasserting itself. Schedules. Protocols. The machinery of normalcy that made everything else possible.

---

She almost didn't make it to Teiti.

The security officer found her in the corridor outside the mess hall—young, professional, his Consortium badge catching the overhead light. He didn't touch her. He didn't need to.

"Ms. Diallo." Not a question. He knew exactly who she was. "The press facilities are on Deck 12. This section isn't included in your access authorization."

"I was interviewing passengers. Human interest material." She kept her voice level, professional. Two decades of checkpoints had taught her how to perform compliance while calculating resistance. "The lottery winners. Their stories."

"The lottery winners are on the Standard deck. Levels 5 through 9." His eyes moved to her tablet, to the recorder she'd slipped into her pocket. "This is Economy. Worker compensation passengers. Different authorization."

"I wasn't aware the human interest extended only to certain humans."

Too far. She heard it the moment it left her mouth. She watched him tap his badge twice—not scanning anything, just a habit, or maybe a signal to the system that this interaction was being noted. The gesture was small and professional and it made her skin crawl.

"I can escort you back to the press facilities," he said. "Or I can note that you've been reminded of the access protocols and trust that you'll comply."

The choice that wasn't a choice. She could push back and lose access to everything, or she could perform gratitude for being allowed to continue at all.

"I appreciate the reminder," she said. The words tasted like copper.

He nodded and moved on. She stood in the corridor for a long moment, the taste of copper still in her mouth.

She waited until he was out of sight. Then she turned back toward the workers' section.

---

She found Teiti Nakibae in the storage bay that had been transformed into a *maneaba*.

The space was quiet now—the ceremony had ended days ago, but the signs of it remained. Woven pandanus mats covering the deck plates. A small bowl of seawater on a makeshift altar. The faint scent of something organic, out of place in the recycled air of the climber.

Teiti sat alone near the porthole, her back straight despite her seventy-one years, her white hair bright against the amber emergency lighting. She did not look up when Amara entered.

"I've been expecting you," Teiti said. Her voice was quiet, unhurried. "The journalist. Diallo. You've been in the workers' section all morning."

Amara stopped at the edge of the mats, uncertain whether to step onto them. The space felt sacred—not in the way of churches or temples, but in the older way, the way of places where grief had been spoken aloud and the walls had absorbed it.

"I wasn't sure you'd see me," Amara said.

"I wasn't sure I would either." Teiti's eyes remained on the porthole, on the Earth that filled its frame. "But you've been listening. To Rosalinda. To Mohammad. To Blessing. That's not nothing. Most journalists want to talk. You wanted to hear."

"May I sit?"

Teiti gestured to a mat beside her. Not across from her—beside. The positioning of equals, or perhaps of fellow travelers on a road whose destination was uncertain.

Amara removed her shoes—instinct, respect, the muscle memory of spaces where feet should be bare—and settled onto the mat. The weave was rough against her skin, the smell of pandanus sharp and green.

"You've been covering the elevator for eight years," Teiti said. It wasn't a question.

"Yes."

"I remember some of your pieces. The 2079 radiation disclosure. The Orbital Workers' Collective formation. The piece on the lottery system—how the odds work, who actually wins." Teiti's voice carried neither approval nor criticism, just the flat assessment of someone cataloging facts. "Careful work. Thorough. Accurate, as far as it goes."

"As far as it goes," Amara repeated. "That's a qualification."

"It's an observation." Teiti finally turned to look at her. Her eyes were dark, deep-set, carrying decades of seeing things that couldn't be unseen. "Your work tells part of the story. The part that can be told without losing access. The part that challenges the Consortium just enough to maintain credibility, not enough to make them close the door." She paused. "I'm not judging. It's how journalism works. I understand constraints."

Amara felt the words land—precise, accurate, devastating in their gentleness.

"You're not wrong," she said.

"I know I'm not wrong." Teiti turned back to the porthole. "The question is whether you know it. And whether knowing it changes what you do."

Silence settled between them. Through the porthole, Earth turned slowly, clouds drifting across oceans, the Pacific visible as a vast blue absence where land should have been.

"I held a ceremony here," Teiti said. "Three nights ago. The twelve I-Kiribati aboard. We spoke the old words. We named what was lost." Her voice softened. "Nei Teresia wept. She's forty-seven, born in Te Rarawa. She's never seen the reef. She mourns what she never knew, and I held her while she wept."

"I heard about the ceremony," Amara said. "The workers speak of it."

"They would. They understand." Teiti's hand moved to the small bowl on the altar, touching the water's surface with one finger. "This is from Te Rarawa harbor. The water that covers where the reef once lived. I bring it with me, wherever I go. So the reef travels too."

Amara felt something shift in her chest—the particular expansion that happened when a story began to exceed its container, when the facts she had gathered became insufficient for the truth she was witnessing.

"Mrs. Nakibae—"

"Teiti. Or Mama Teiti, if you want to use what the workers call me." A slight smile crossed her weathered face. "Mrs. Nakibae was my mother-in-law, and she died before the Compact was signed."

"Teiti." Amara drew breath. "I've spent the morning listening. Rosalinda Cruz. Mohammad Ali. Blessing Okoro. Others, in smaller conversations. I've heard the pattern. The promises broken. The deaths classified as acceptable loss. The settlements designed to silence." She paused. "I've known most of this for years. But hearing it here, in this space, from people who lived it—"

"It becomes real," Teiti said. "That's the difference. The facts you know and the truth you feel. They're not the same thing."

"No. They're not."

Teiti was quiet for a moment. Her finger still rested on the water's surface, creating small ripples that caught the amber light.

"What do you want from me?" she asked. "The interview you've been seeking since before we boarded. The story you think I can give you. What is it?"

Amara had prepared answers to this question. Professional answers. Journalistic frameworks about primary sources and historical documentation and the importance of first-person testimony. But sitting on the woven mat, with the Earth turning in the porthole and the weight of the morning's conversations pressing on her chest, the prepared answers felt hollow.

"I don't know," she said. "I thought I knew. I thought I wanted the story—the definitive account, the interview that would anchor everything else, the testimony that would make the piece undeniable." She shook her head. "But now I'm not sure that's enough. I'm not sure a story is what's needed."

"What is needed?"

"I don't know that either."

Teiti's expression shifted—something that might have been approval, or recognition, or simply the acknowledgment of honest uncertainty.

"Good," she said. "That's a better starting place than most journalists reach."

She withdrew her hand from the water and dried it on her lap. For a moment, she seemed to be deciding something—weighing options, calculating risks, the same process Amara had watched a hundred subjects go through when they stood at the edge of testimony.

"I'll tell you about my husband," Teiti said. "And my son. And the reef that's buried under the city where they built this tower. I'll tell you what I told the workers in this room three nights ago—what we carry, what we've lost, what we refuse to let be forgotten."

"Thank you—"

"Wait." Teiti held up a hand. "I'll tell you these things. But first, I have a question. And I need you to answer honestly, not professionally."

"Ask."

"What story will you tell?" Teiti's eyes locked onto hers—direct, unflinching, the gaze of someone who had spent decades learning to see through careful words to the intentions beneath them. "You have access. You have a platform. You have years of credibility and the trust of editors who will publish what you file. You could tell a story that challenges the Consortium just enough—that wins awards, that gets quoted, that becomes part of the careful narrative of reform without revolution. Or you could tell a story that costs you everything—your access, your career, your place at the table. What story will you tell?"

The question hung in the space between them. Amara felt it pressing against her chest, demanding an answer she hadn't yet found.

"I don't know," she said again. "I'm not trying to evade. I genuinely don't know. I can see both paths. I can see myself filing a feature—powerful, important, carefully framed to maximize impact while minimizing risk. I can also see myself—" She stopped. Drew breath. "I can also see myself filing everything. The testimony. The documents. The pattern laid bare. Burning every bridge I've spent twenty-three years building."

"And which do you want to do?"

"I want to tell the truth. All of it. I want to stop managing and start witnessing." The words surprised her with their force. "But I have a daughter. I have responsibilities. I have—" She laughed, a sound without humor. "I have the same calculations everyone makes. The same weighing of costs against conscience. The same rationalization that turns betrayal into pragmatism."

And underneath that, the thought she couldn't say aloud: *I'm forty years old and I've built something. A reputation. A platform. People return my calls. Editors trust my judgment. If I burn it—*

Rosalinda Cruz had waited twenty years for a non-disclosure clause to expire. And Amara Diallo was worried about her *platform*.

Teiti's eyes said she saw it clearly.

Teiti was silent for a long moment. The climber hummed around them, carrying them higher through the void. Earth turned in the porthole, blue and white and impossibly distant.

"My husband was forty-three when he died," Teiti said finally. Her voice was different now—softer, more personal, the voice of someone beginning a story rather than testing an interlocutor. "Teriki Nakibae. He worked the anchor construction, the subsea foundation. The most dangerous labor the Consortium offered. He did it because they promised passage. They promised that the workers who built the tower would ride it to the stars."

She paused. The silence stretched.

"October 17, 2065. The anchor collapse. He was in Section Seven when the cofferdam failed. The investigation said it was geological factors—unforeseen, unforeseeable. The investigation did not mention the three safety reports filed in the weeks before. The investigation did not mention the cost-cutting that led to inferior welds. The investigation did not mention that Teriki had called me the night before, worried, telling me something felt wrong in the structure."

Her voice remained steady, but Amara could hear the effort it required—the decades of practice that had transformed raw grief into testimony.

"My son, Tebuke, was fourteen when his father died. He watched me fight for three years to get Teriki's name on the memorial wall—the official one, not the Shadow Memorial we built ourselves. He watched me refuse the settlement that would have silenced me. He watched me become Mama Teiti, the elder who won't stop speaking names."

She stopped. Her hand returned to the water bowl, fingertips touching the surface.

"And then Tebuke grew up and went to work on the same tower that killed his father. Because what else was there? The jobs were there. The money was there. The choice was no choice at all. He worked the mid-altitude sections, the radiation-heavy zones. He was healthy when he started. Six years later, the cancer came. They denied the claim. They said it was unrelated. He died in 2078, in a hospital in Te Rarawa, looking out the window at the tower that killed him. He was thirty-one years old."

Amara felt tears on her face. She hadn't noticed them starting.

"I'm telling you this," Teiti said, "because you asked what story you should tell. And I can't answer that for you. But I can tell you what stories matter. Not the stories that explain. Not the stories that analyze. Not the stories that carefully frame injustice so that it becomes bearable, manageable, acceptable as the cost of progress." Her voice hardened. "The stories that matter are the ones that refuse to make it acceptable. That name the dead and don't move on. That sit with the grief instead of processing it into content."

"I don't know if I know how to tell that kind of story," Amara said. "I've been trained to frame, to contextualize, to—"

"Then unlearn it." Teiti's voice was gentle but implacable. "Or don't. That's your choice. But don't pretend the choice isn't there. Don't pretend that careful framing is neutrality. It's a position. It's a side. And the side you're on when you tell a story is the side you're on."

---

They talked for two hours.

Teiti told her about Teriki—not the death, which had been told so many times it had become smooth with handling, but the life. The way he laughed. The way he held their children. The way he came home from work, exhausted, coated in salt and grime, and still found the energy to tell her about his day. The man, not the martyr. The human being, not the symbol.

She told her about the reef. Not the statistics—the hectares destroyed, the species lost, the ecosystem erased—but the memories. Swimming with her grandfather in water so clear you could see to the bottom. Fish so thick you could walk on their backs, as the old people claimed. The coral that glowed pink and gold and purple in the shallows. The world that was, before the world that is.

She told her about the ceremony. About Nei Teresia weeping for a homeland she had never known. About the twelve I-Kiribati gathering in a cargo hold to speak words the Consortium would never hear. About inheritance and grief and the carrying of things that could not be set down.

And she asked questions. About Aïssatou, the daughter watching from Paris. About Amara's mother, dying slowly in Dakar. About the eight years of coverage, the stories filed and the stories held, the calculations that had led her to this moment.

"You're not just interviewing me," Amara said at one point. "You're interviewing me."

"Of course." Teiti's smile was slight, knowing. "How else would I know what to give you? You're not a recording device. You're a person. What you carry shapes what you can carry. I need to know you before I know what story you can hold."

"And do you? Know what story I can hold?"

Teiti was quiet for a long moment. The porthole showed Earth, half-illuminated now as they rose into a different angle with the sun. The Pacific was in shadow, the place where the reef once lived invisible in the dark.

"I know you're capable of telling the truth," Teiti said finally. "I know you're afraid of what it will cost. I know you have reasons for the fear—real reasons, responsibilities, people who depend on you." She paused. "I have watched men die for schedules. I have held women whose husbands didn't come home because someone decided the repair could wait. And I know that you came here. You spent the morning listening to people the Consortium would prefer you ignore. You sat on my mat and you wept when I told you about Teriki. That's not nothing. That's someone whose conscience is still working."

"My conscience working doesn't help the dead."

"No. It doesn't." Teiti's voice faltered—the first crack Amara had heard in it. "And I don't know if it helps the living either. I've been speaking names for thirty years. Teriki's name. Tebuke's name. The 847. The ones they don't count. I've spoken until my voice broke and I've watched the tower keep rising and I've watched the settlements keep coming and I've watched—" She stopped. Drew breath. When she continued, her voice was quieter. "Some days I think the speaking matters. Other days I think I'm just making noise so I don't have to be silent. I don't know which days are true."

The admission hung in the space between them. Amara felt something shift—not pity, but recognition. The uncertainty of someone who had committed everything to a path and still didn't know if it led anywhere.

"But you keep speaking," Amara said.

"I keep speaking." Teiti's hand returned to the water bowl, steadying herself. "Because the alternative is worse. Because silence is also a choice, and I know what that choice means. So I speak, and I don't know if it helps, and I speak anyway." Her eyes met Amara's. "That's all I can offer you. Not certainty. Not a guarantee that truth-telling changes anything. Just the knowledge that not telling is also a position. Also a side."

She was quiet for a moment. Then, more gently: "I'm not asking you to save anyone. I'm asking you to witness. To see. To remember. What you do with the seeing and the remembering—that's your choice. But the choice is real. Don't pretend it isn't."

Amara left the storage bay as the artificial afternoon began.

The corridors of the Economy deck were busier now—workers and lottery winners moving toward common areas, the daily rhythms of the voyage reasserting themselves. She passed Mohammad Ali in a corridor; he nodded once, silent, the acknowledgment of someone who had given testimony and was waiting to see what would be done with it. She passed Rosalinda Cruz near the mess hall entrance; the Filipino woman's eyes asked a question Amara couldn't yet answer.

The service corridor that led back to the Business deck was quiet. She walked slowly, her recorder still running in her pocket, the weight of the morning's conversations pressing against her chest.

She had the story. Not all of it—a story like this had no edges, no boundaries, it spread in every direction like ripples from a stone dropped in still water—but enough. Enough to file a devastating feature. Enough to challenge the Consortium's narrative with testimony they couldn't dismiss. Enough to win awards, if she framed it carefully. Enough to matter, in the careful, managed, professional way that journalism usually mattered.

But Teiti's question followed her through the corridor, pressing against the back of her mind: *What story will you tell?*

Not which facts would she include. Not how would she frame the narrative. But what kind of story. What kind of witness.

She reached the junction where the service corridor met the passenger areas. Left led to the press room, to her workstation, to the uplink that would carry her words to billions of people who would read them and feel appropriately moved and then move on with their lives. Right led—she didn't know where. The observation deck, maybe. The places where other passengers were having conversations she wasn't part of.

She stood at the junction for a long moment, feeling the climber rise beneath her feet, carrying her toward a destination she hadn't yet chosen.

Her tablet buzzed. Her editor: *Checking in—need your Day 3 color by 1800 UTC. Human interest angle. The view, the passengers, the maiden voyage atmosphere.*

Human interest. Color. Atmosphere.

Amara looked at the message for a long time. She could feel the shape of what James wanted—she'd filed a hundred pieces that fit it. The wonder. The diversity. The carefully curated emotion that made readers feel good about humanity's achievements without asking what the achievements had cost.

*That's not journalism. That's brochure copy.*

But she'd built her career on it. On being good enough to matter, careful enough to last. On telling truths that were true but not too true. On being the journalist editors trusted because she understood the difference between a story and a problem.

She began composing her reply.

*Gathering material. Need more time. Story is bigger than expected.*

Her thumb hovered over send. Then she opened her photo archive, scrolled to the image she'd taken in the *maneaba*—the water bowl, the woven mats, the amber light falling across Teiti's hands. She attached it. Added one line: *This is what I'm looking at.*

She sent it before she could reconsider. James would see it. James would know it wasn't color. James would call her, and she would have to explain something she couldn't yet explain.

A small defiance. A cost she couldn't take back.

Then she turned right, away from the press room, toward the observation deck where the view might help her think.

The story was there, waiting. She just had to decide what kind of story it would be.

The observation deck was crowded at midday, but Amara found a quiet corner near the secondary viewport—the smaller one that faced backward, toward the Earth they were leaving rather than the hub they were approaching.

She sat on the bench and looked at the planet that contained everything. Her daughter. Her mother. The waters of the Pacific, dark and blue, hiding the grave of a reef and the ghost of a husband and the accumulated weight of everything that had been lost so this tower could rise.

*What story will you tell?*

She didn't know yet. But she was starting to understand the question.

The climber rose. The Earth shrank. And Amara Diallo sat with what she had gathered, waiting for the shape of it to become clear.
