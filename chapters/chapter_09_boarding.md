# Chapter 9: Boarding

## I. Teiti

The vibration never stopped.

Teiti lay her palm flat against the wall of her cabin—number 7, economy deck, a space no larger than the sleeping quarters she had shared with Teriki in the early construction years. The hum traveled through her bones, through the arthritic joints of her fingers, through the scar tissue on her palm where a cable had once snapped and torn her open. The climber was alive. She had always known this, had felt it in the anchor platform when she worked the assembly lines, but knowing and feeling were different things.

The cabin held four bunks, but she was alone for now. Her bunkmates—three women from the secondary lottery, she had seen their names on the door panel—had not yet arrived. Perhaps they were exploring. Perhaps they were pressed against observation windows somewhere, watching the terminal shrink. She did not begrudge them their wonder.

She sat on the lower bunk, her bag beside her, and let the vibration fill her.

Through the small window—no larger than her spread hand—the city was already changing shape. Te Rarawa spread below in its rings of light and concrete, and from this angle she could see the workers' quarter where she had lived for thirty-eight years. The Shadow Memorial would be invisible at this distance, but she looked for it anyway, her eyes finding the approximate location where 1,247 names waited in concrete for her return.

The photograph was in her bag. She did not take it out. She did not need to see his face; she carried it behind her eyes, in the space where memory lived. Instead, she pressed both hands to the wall and let the climber's pulse answer her own.

The drive mechanism was electromagnetic—she knew this from the technical briefings the Union had demanded, from the specifications she had memorized in the years when understanding felt like resistance. The ribbon passed through the climber's core, and the mechanism gripped it and pulled, and the whole structure rose on a thread of carbon and ambition.

She closed her eyes and spoke quietly in Gilbertese, the words meant only for the dead: "*Te mauri, te raoi, ao te tabomoa.*" Health, peace, and prosperity. The blessing her mother had spoken over departing fishermen, over canoes setting out across waters that no longer existed in their original form.

The climber trembled, and rose, and carried her with it.

## II. Yusuf

The corridor was narrower than it should have been.

Yusuf stood in the passage outside his cabin—number 9, two doors down from Mama Teiti's—and let his shoulders measure the space. Sixty centimeters to either wall. His hands, if he extended them, could touch both sides at once. In the construction years he had worked in tighter spaces. Those had been functional. This was supposed to be accommodation.

A man passed him, clutching a small bag, his face carrying the particular brightness of lottery winners—that mixture of disbelief and joy that hadn't yet curdled into awareness. He nodded at Yusuf; Yusuf nodded back. The man continued toward the elevator bank, probably heading for the observation deck, probably eager to see what he had won the right to see.

Yusuf did not move.

He was listening.

The climber spoke in sounds he recognized: the hum of electromagnetic drives, different in timber from the construction rigs but built on the same principles. The whisper of air circulation, pushing recycled atmosphere through ducts he had helped specify in the early design reviews. The creak of structural members adjusting to load, the almost-inaudible groan of carbon composite under tension.

He knew these sounds. He had lived inside them for seven years, had fallen asleep to them and woken to them, had heard them change when something was wrong. The climber was healthy—he could tell that much without looking at a single diagnostic panel. The rhythm was steady, the creaks were settling, the drives were pulling smoothly.

His hands knew too. Without thinking, he had pressed his right palm to the wall, feeling for vibration frequencies, for the subtle harmonics that would tell him if the structure was stressed or stable. The wall was warm—climate control working, insulation sufficient—and the vibration was clean, no flutter, no resonance.

*I built this*, he thought. Not this specific panel, perhaps, but panels like it. The standards, the tolerances, the specifications. His labor was woven into the structure's bones.

Through the narrow window at the corridor's end, he could see a sliver of sky—blue shading toward black at the edges, the atmosphere already thinning as they rose. He thought of Fatima, of Nadia and Omar, of the apartment they would be watching from now. He had promised to send videos. He had promised to draw stars.

He had also promised to come back. That was the promise that mattered.

The man who had passed him was out of sight now, swallowed by the elevator bank, ascending toward the observation deck where the wealthy and the workers would share the same view for a few scheduled hours. Yusuf did not follow. Not yet. He wanted to stand here a moment longer, in the narrow corridor of the economy deck, feeling the structure he had built rise around him.

He pressed his hand to the wall and felt the climber's heartbeat answer.

## III. Henrik

The champagne was excellent.

Henrik stood at the observation port of his suite—Level 15, premium deck, a space larger than some of the economy cabins held four passengers—and watched the world rearrange itself. Te Rarawa was shrinking, its rings of light and concrete becoming abstract, becoming pattern rather than place. From this height, the class divisions were invisible. The workers' quarter and the Ascension District were simply rings, variations in light intensity, data points in an urban geography that no longer required his navigation.

He sipped the champagne and felt the subtle tremor of the drive mechanism through the deck plates. Smooth. Professional. The climber's manufacturers had done their work well—Lindqvist Orbital had supplied thirty-two percent of the composite panels, and he allowed himself a moment of proprietary satisfaction at the quality of the ride.

The suite was everything the brochures had promised: sitting area with actual furniture, not fold-down surfaces; sleep chamber with a bed rather than a bunk; bathroom with genuine water pressure, not the recycling systems that served the lower decks. Through the interior window, he could see the Grand Atrium several levels below—a vertical garden spanning multiple decks, its living walls breathing oxygen into the filtered air, its design meant to evoke cathedral scale and natural wonder.

He should go down there. The reception was scheduled to begin in an hour, and he had obligations—conversations to seed, relationships to maintain, the endless social choreography of influence. Erik had already messaged twice about the Hashimoto proposal, and Anna was probably assembling briefing materials in the business center.

Instead, he stayed at the window.

The view was doing something to him. He had seen Earth from aircraft, from the windows of the orbital shuttle that had carried him to the hub three years ago on a cargo inspection trip. But this was different. This was slow. The planet was not shrinking in a rush of acceleration; it was receding gradually, patiently, as if giving him time to understand what he was leaving.

The tether rose above and below, a ribbon of silver catching the light, and he could trace it downward to where it vanished into the atmosphere's haze. Everything he owned was down there. Every asset, every contract, every relationship that defined his position in the world's economy. From here, it was all indistinguishable from the ocean, from the clouds, from the patterns of light and shadow that made Earth beautiful and small.

He had felt this before—the moment on the aircraft, watching the terminal approach, when something like awe had stirred in his chest. He felt it again now, stronger, less easily dismissed.

His father would have appreciated this view. Sven Lindqvist, who had risked the family fortune on a dream of towers reaching to heaven, who had believed when belief was expensive. Henrik raised his glass to the window, to the memory, to the shrinking world below.

"To vision," he said quietly. The words felt insufficient, but he said them anyway.

The champagne was excellent. The view was something else. He did not like that it was getting under his skin.

Somewhere below him, in the decks he had never visited and never would, five hundred people were experiencing the same ascent from entirely different worlds. He wondered, briefly, what they saw.

Then the thought passed, and he turned to prepare for the reception.

## IV. Miriam

She walked through her blueprints.

The corridor on Level 15 was exactly as she had specified: 1.2 meters wide, ceiling height 2.4 meters, composite panels rated for pressure differential and thermal variation. The lighting strips ran along the junction of wall and ceiling at precisely the angle she had calculated for optimal visibility with minimal glare. The handholds were positioned at intervals she had determined through ergonomic modeling, back when she had believed that every detail mattered.

Every detail did matter. That was the problem. The details accumulated into systems, and the systems accumulated into structures, and the structures accumulated into this—a vessel carrying five hundred people toward orbit, with class divisions built into every specification.

The premium deck was beautiful. She had not designed it—the interior architects had handled passenger accommodations—but she had signed off on the structural parameters that made it possible. Wider corridors up here, taller ceilings, more mass allocated per passenger. The same physics that determined load distributions had determined who got space and who got compression.

She found her suite—1547, a number she had not chosen—and pressed her palm to the access panel. The door slid open on a room that was larger than the apartment where she had grown up in Lagos, larger than the dormitory she had shared with three other engineering students at Imperial. Her bag was already there, placed by a steward she had not seen.

She did not enter.

Instead, she stood in the doorway, looking.

The vibration was present here too, but muted—the premium deck had additional dampening, a specification she remembered approving in a meeting where they had discussed passenger comfort and nobody had mentioned that comfort was being rationed by price. Through the observation port, she could see the tether stretching above, silver against the darkening sky, and she could see Earth below, already curved at the edges, already becoming something other than ground.

She had drawn that curve—not the planet's curve, but the observation port's, the angle calculated to maximize the visible arc while maintaining structural integrity. Three days on that calculation, back when she had believed that giving people a view of their world from above would change how they saw it.

Maybe it would. Maybe that was why she was here.

She stepped into the suite and let the door close behind her.

The room was silent except for the hum of the drive and the whisper of climate control. She set her bag on the bed—queen-sized, real mattress, sheets that were probably thread-counted into the hundreds—and walked to the window.

Earth was there. Earth was always there, from every window on every deck. That had been the one specification she had fought for, the one she had won: no cabin without a view. Let them see what they were leaving. Let them see what they were rising above. Let them understand, if they could, what it meant to build a ladder to the stars.

She pressed her forehead to the glass and felt the cold, and the vibration, and the weight of thirty years.

*What did you build?* she asked herself. *Who did you build it for?*

The planet offered no answer. But it was beautiful, and she had made this possible, and somewhere in the decks below her, a man with two missing fingers was riding the structure he had assembled with his hands, and an elder was carrying a photograph of a husband who had died so this moment could happen.

Miriam stayed at the window, watching Earth shrink, and did not look away.

## V. Zara

The cabin was exactly in the middle.

Standard deck, Level 22, shared quarters with three other scholarship students—Fatou from Senegal, Priya from Mumbai, and Emma from Stockholm. The walls were composite gray, the bunks were functional, the window was larger than economy but smaller than business. The Consortium had calibrated everything precisely: prestigious enough to photograph, modest enough to demonstrate humility.

Zara sat on her assigned bunk—upper left, which meant climbing—and watched her cabinmates settle in.

Fatou was arranging prayer items on a small shelf, her movements careful, reverent. Priya had already connected her tablet to the cabin's network and was reviewing what looked like research data, her focus absolute. Emma—Henrik Lindqvist's niece, though she seemed uncomfortable when anyone mentioned it—stood at the window, her reflection ghostly against the darkening sky.

None of them were talking. The photo sessions were over, the handlers were elsewhere, and for the first time since arriving in Te Rarawa, they were not being watched.

"So," Zara said. "This is it."

Emma turned from the window. "The scholarship experience." Her voice was dry, carrying undertones that Zara recognized—the particular exhaustion of someone who had been performing all day.

"At least the beds are real beds," Priya said without looking up from her tablet. "I expected worse."

"You expected dormitory pods." Fatou's voice was gentle, her English careful. "I read about them. The original designs had dormitory pods for standard class."

"They changed it for optics," Zara said. "Hard to photograph 'reaching for the stars together' when half the stars are sleeping in tubes."

The comment landed differently than she'd intended—sharper, more bitter. Emma's eyes flickered; Fatou paused in her arrangements; Priya finally looked up.

"You sound like my father," Priya said. "He said the scholarship was colonialism with better marketing."

"Did he try to stop you from coming?"

"He helped me with my application." Priya's smile was complicated. "He also said I should see the system from inside before I decided how to fight it."

Through the window, Earth was becoming something else—not a place where they stood, but a place they had left. The curvature was visible now, the atmosphere a thin blue line against the black beyond.

"Can you feel it?" Emma asked quietly. She was still at the window, her hand pressed to the glass. "The vibration. It's like... a heartbeat."

Zara could feel it. Through the bunk, through the floor, through the air itself—a pulse that was regular and mechanical and somehow, despite everything, alive. The climber was rising, carrying them with it, and the physics of that carrying was beautiful in the way that all elegant engineering was beautiful.

The physics of who got to experience it—that was less beautiful.

"My mother is down there somewhere," Fatou said. She had stopped arranging, was looking at the window though she couldn't see it from her angle. "In Dakar. Watching the coverage, probably. Praying."

"Mine too," Zara said. "In London. With my dad and my brother. They'll be recording everything, analyzing every shot for glimpses of me."

"My family is up there." Emma nodded toward the ceiling, toward the premium decks above. "Not my parents—they stayed home. But my uncle. His company built the panels."

She said it flatly, without pride or apology. Just a fact about her position in the structure that was carrying them.

"We should go to the observation deck," Zara said. "When it opens. General access."

"To see the view?"

"To see who else is there."

She thought of the elderly woman she had glimpsed through the staging area's windows, the one in traditional dress who had refused the VIP escort.

Priya set her tablet down. "The workers. The compensation passengers."

"And the woman who organized their union." Zara had done her research; she always did. "Teiti Nakibae. She's in the economy section. She's been fighting the Consortium since before we were born."

Fatou's expression shifted—recognition, or interest. "My mother mentioned her. There was a documentary, years ago. She spoke about the dead."

"She'll be at the observation deck," Zara said. "If she's anything like the footage, she won't miss the chance to see what was destroyed."

The cabin fell silent. Through the window, Earth continued to curve, continued to recede, continued to become the blue marble that photographs had shown them since childhood but that none of them had ever seen with their own eyes.

Zara climbed down from her bunk. "I'm going to explore. See the common areas before they fill up. Anyone coming?"

Emma hesitated, then nodded. Priya was already reaching for her tablet, ready to document. Fatou finished her arrangement—a small mat, a string of beads, items that suggested a faith that would travel with her—and rose as well.

They left the cabin together, four scholarship students stepping into a vessel that had been built to sort people by value, walking toward whatever understanding they could find.

## VI. Amara

The press room was thirty square meters of managed truth.

Amara sat at her workstation, back to the wall, eyes on the door—habits learned in conflict zones, never quite unlearned. Through the narrow window, she could see a slice of the atrium below, its living walls and cathedral space visible but distant, other people's wonder framed for observation.

Her tablet displayed the footage she'd already captured: boarding sequences from the official feed, her own shots of the passenger flow through the one-way glass, the moment when Teiti Nakibae had refused redirection and walked into the workers' channel with her head held high. That footage would not appear in her first dispatch. It was being held, encrypted, waiting for the right moment.

Heinrich was at the workstation beside her, editing something; Michael was across the room, in quiet conversation with the BBC team. The atmosphere was professional, competitive, collegial—journalists doing what journalists did, finding angles, shaping narratives, deciding what the world would understand about this voyage.

Her phone buzzed. A message from Aïssatou: *Mama I saw the elevator moving! Papa says you're inside! Are you flying yet?*

She typed back: *Not flying, climbing. Like a very slow, very tall ladder. I'll send you pictures of the stars when we get high enough.*

*Promise?*

*Promise.*

She set the phone aside and returned to her footage.

The official narrative was already taking shape in the feeds: historic voyage, human achievement, diverse passengers united in wonder. The press materials emphasized the lottery winners, the scholarship students, the "worker honorees" whose presence demonstrated that access was expanding. The camera angles had been chosen to capture embracing families, children pointing at windows, faces illuminated by the light of Earth.

What the cameras didn't capture—what she had noted in her shorthand—was the architecture of separation. The different boarding channels, the varying widths of corridors, the precise calibration of amenities by deck. The way a person's ticket determined not just where they slept but how much space they were permitted to occupy, how much air they were allocated, how much of the view they could see.

She had covered conflicts where the lines of division were marked by checkpoints and walls. Here, the lines were marked by carpet quality and window size. More sophisticated. No less absolute.

Her tablet chimed: a message from Daniela, her handler. *Chairman Murakami's office has confirmed a brief availability tomorrow, Day 2, 1400 hours. Background only. Questions to be submitted in advance.*

She typed back acknowledgment, already drafting questions she knew would be rejected.

The press room's main screen showed the official feed: the climber's exterior, captured by chase cameras, a silver needle rising from a blue-and-white marble. Beautiful footage. The kind that would lead newscasts around the world, that would accompany headlines about humanity's reach for the stars.

She thought of Teiti Nakibae, somewhere in the economy section, carrying a photograph of a husband who had died building this beautiful thing. She thought of the workers she'd interviewed over years of covering the elevator: the injuries, the broken promises, the names carved into concrete because the official memorials weren't enough.

She opened a new file and began to write.

*The Babel Elevator rises like a promise. Five hundred passengers ascend toward orbit, their faces turned toward windows that show them Earth as they have never seen it: curved, blue, heartbreakingly whole. Among them are executives and artists, scientists and lottery winners, journalists and workers who helped build the very structure that carries them. Among them is an elderly woman who refused VIP accommodations to board with the people she has spent her life defending—people whose labor made this miracle possible, whose losses have been memorialized in concrete because the Consortium preferred to forget.*

*This is the story of that ascent. Not only the wonder of it, but the weight.*

She saved the draft, closed the file, and looked out the narrow window at the slice of atrium visible below.

Somewhere in the decks above and below her, five hundred people were experiencing the same ascent from entirely different worlds. Her job was to find the threads that connected them, to weave them into something that an audience on Earth could understand.

The climber rose. The story was just beginning.

## VII. Kenji

The smile was still in place.

Kenji stood at the entrance to the VIP lounge, greeting passengers as they arrived for the informal pre-departure gathering—a Chairman's welcome, his staff had called it, though he had not welcomed anything in years. The routine was automatic: handshake, eye contact, personal word, move on. He had performed it so many times that the performance had become indistinguishable from himself.

Ambassador Sharma arrived with her delegation; he complimented her sari and asked after her daughter's university studies. Lin Xiaoming arrived alone, characteristically, and their exchange was brief and cautious—the tech billionaire had been critical of the Consortium in public, though his presence here suggested the criticism had limits. Henrik appeared with his entourage, smooth and charming, and Kenji matched his smoothness while cataloging every tell: the slight tension in Henrik's jaw that meant he wanted something, the way his eyes kept flicking to the window as if calculating returns on the view.

Through it all, the climber rose, and the vibration traveled through the deck, and Kenji felt it in his feet the way he felt every aspect of this structure—as weight, as responsibility, as judgment.

He had walked these decks before, during the final inspections, before the first cargo runs began. He had stood in corridors that were empty then and were full now, touched walls that had been silent and now hummed with the pulse of the drive. This vessel was his responsibility in a way that the distant operations—the cargo schedules, the maintenance budgets, the negotiations that kept the whole system functioning—could never be. This was immediate. This was present.

And somewhere below, in the economy section, Yusuf Haddad was feeling the same pulse through different walls.

Kenji did not look for him. He did not need to. The knowledge was enough—the awareness that the man whose life he had failed to save (no, that wasn't right; he had saved Kenji's life, and Kenji had failed to save his future) was aboard this vessel, rising toward orbit on a ticket that Kenji had sent without a note because he could not find words for what the ticket meant.

The answers shifted every time he asked: guilt, obligation, the hope that seeing Yusuf ascend would mean something, the fear that it would mean nothing. The truth, maybe, was simpler: he wanted to be seen. By the one person who knew exactly what he was.

"Chairman." Hiro appeared at his elbow, tablet in hand. "The reception lineup is confirmed. Brief remarks in twenty minutes, then circulation."

"The worker delegation?"

Again, the flicker of surprise. "Settled in economy. No incidents."

"Good."

"Is there something specific you'd like me to—"

"No." Kenji cut him off, more sharply than intended. "That's all."

Hiro retreated, making notes, probably flagging the exchange for later analysis. The Consortium's internal communications were monitored—Kenji knew this because he had approved the monitoring—and his staff would wonder why the Chairman kept asking about workers when he had never asked before.

Let them wonder. Let them flag it. Let them add it to the dossier that was probably already thick with evidence of his exhaustion, his hesitation, his increasingly visible cracks.

He turned back to the window.

Earth was beautiful from here. It was always beautiful, at every altitude, in every light. That was the cruelty of it—the planet did not change because you saw it differently. It remained what it was: blue and white and brown and green, wrapped in a thin skin of atmosphere, carrying eight billion people who would never see this view.

Takeshi had wanted this. He had wanted people to see Earth from above, to feel the overview effect that astronauts described, to understand that the divisions they clung to were invisible from space. *The elevator will change how we see ourselves*, he had said, in speeches Kenji could still recite from memory. *It will give us perspective*.

And it did. The perspective was: we built a miracle, and then we rationed it. We promised access, and then we counted the cost. We said *humanity's triumph*, and we meant *some humans*.

Kenji raised his glass—water, not champagne; he needed clarity—and drank.

In twenty minutes, he would give brief remarks. He would speak of vision, and achievement, and the future. He would perform the role he had been chosen for, the role that had consumed him, the role that was all he had left.

And then, at some point in the next seven days, he would find Yusuf Haddad.

Kenji turned from the window, adjusted his cuffs, and walked into the lounge to perform triumph.

The climber rose around him, carrying five hundred people toward orbit, each of them experiencing the same miracle from worlds that would never touch.

---

The observation deck opened at 1500 hours.

They came from every level—premium and business and standard and economy, flowing through the elevator banks like tributaries merging into a river. The deck was designed for 200 at capacity, with curved windows that offered 270 degrees of Earth and sky. For one hour, every passenger was equal before the view.

They were not equal, of course. Nothing about them was equal. But for one hour, they stood side by side and looked at the same world from the same distance, and something happened in that looking that was harder to dismiss than the architecture that separated them.

A lottery winner from Manila stood next to a tech executive from Shanghai, both of them silent, both of them weeping.

A construction worker from Jordan—two fingers missing on his left hand—pressed his palm to the window and felt, through the glass, the structure he had built rising beneath him.

An elderly woman in traditional woven mat stood at the window's center, looking down at water that had once held reef and now held only memory.

An industrialist from Stockholm stood near the edge, his champagne untouched, his expression unreadable.

A journalist from Senegal recorded everything, her camera capturing faces that the official footage would never show.

A scholarship student from London watched an elder she had never met, and thought about what it meant to fight a system from inside it.

An architect stood alone, her forehead pressed to the glass, watching the planet she had helped connect to heaven.

And a Chairman stood at the back, unseen, watching them all.

Earth turned below them. The tether rose above them. The climber carried them upward, past the edge of the atmosphere, toward a destination that was still days away.

They were all aboard now. All five hundred and seventy-five souls—passengers and crew—sealed into a vessel that would lift them toward orbit.

The observation deck's windows caught the light: blue of Earth, silver of tether, black of space beginning to emerge.
