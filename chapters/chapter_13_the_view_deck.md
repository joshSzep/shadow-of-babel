# Chapter 13: The View Deck

The observation dome was full.

Amara had arrived early—a journalist's habit, positioning before the story began—but even twenty minutes before the posted opening time, passengers had gathered at the elevator banks, queuing for the ascent to the crown of the climber. Now, with the dome officially open to all classes for the next two hours, perhaps a hundred and fifty people drifted through the vast transparent space, their faces turned upward and outward, their voices hushed by what they saw.

She found a position near the dome's edge, where the curve of transparent composite met the climber's hull, and let her professional eye catalog the scene. The lottery winners were easy to identify: their wonder was unguarded, their phones and tablets raised in constant documentation, their bodies pressed close to the glass as if proximity might make the view more real. The corporate passengers were smoother, their awe filtered through practiced composure, champagne flutes in hand even at this hour. The workers stood apart, clustered in small groups, their expressions harder to read—something between pride and grief in the set of their shoulders.

And the scholarship students, there by the far curve: young, bright-eyed, caught between the worlds they came from and the one they were entering.

Amara raised her own camera, but didn't photograph. Not yet. She was still learning the composition.

Through the dome, Earth spread below them in impossible blue. They had risen through the night and into a morning that belonged to no time zone—ship standard said 0900, but the sun blazed at an angle that made the Pacific gleam like hammered silver. The curve of the planet was unmistakable now, the horizon bending away at the edges of vision, and the atmosphere showed as a luminous band separating world from void.

She had covered the elevator for eight years. She had interviewed engineers and executives, workers and protesters, lottery winners before and after their ascents. She had thought she understood what they described.

She had understood nothing.

The view was not a sight. It was a rearrangement. Everything she had known about scale and distance and her place in the order of things was quietly, irrevocably shifting. The Pacific Ocean—165 million square kilometers of water—fit in her field of vision. Weather systems she could have spent a week flying through appeared as white brushstrokes on blue canvas. Somewhere down there, Aïssatou was eating breakfast in Paris, and the distance between them was both infinite and trivial.

*This is what they see*, she thought. *The people who make decisions about the world. This is the view from power.*

She pulled out her notebook—physical, analog, a habit from years of covering stories where electronic records could be seized—and wrote: *The view deck. All classes mixing. Watch who watches whom.*

Then she looked up and began to watch.

Miriam had not intended to come.

She had woken early, written three pages of notes that might become memoir, and told herself she would spend the morning in her cabin, avoiding the public spaces where recognition waited. But the cabin had felt small, the walls too close, and when she'd stepped into the corridor for air, her feet had carried her toward the elevators without consultation.

Now she stood near the dome's center, anonymous in the crowd, and let the view do what it would.

The tether stretched above her, a ribbon of silver fire ascending toward stars that were visible even in the full light of morning. Below, it descended toward the planet's surface, toward the anchor city she had helped design, toward the foundations she had calculated and the lives those calculations had cost. From this altitude, the tether was beautiful—impossibly thin, impossibly long, a thread connecting worlds.

She had spent thirty years thinking about that thread. The mathematics of tension and oscillation. The material science of carbon composites that could bear loads no natural substance could survive. The engineering of a structure that hung from the sky, defying every intuition about what was possible.

The numbers had been elegant. The numbers had been beautiful.

The numbers had told her nothing about the 1,247 people who died making them real.

She pressed her palm against the dome's surface, feeling the cool composite, the faint vibration of the climber's systems. Through the transparency, she could see the Pacific spread below—the region where the Phoenix Islands had been, where the reef had lived, where the anchor now sat on a grave of coral and concrete.

*Did you know?* That was the question she would eventually have to answer. Not from journalists, who asked it performatively, expecting deflection. From someone who had the right to ask. From someone who had paid the price.

*Did you know what would be destroyed?*

She had known. Not the names, not the faces, not the specific contours of what would be lost. But she had known that building on that scale required sacrifice, and she had calculated acceptable losses the way she calculated acceptable stress tolerances. The reef had been an abstraction—a data point in an environmental impact assessment, a political obstacle to be negotiated, a cost to be weighed against benefit.

She had weighed it. She had decided the benefit was greater.

Now she stood in the result of that calculation, watching the ocean where the reef had been, and the numbers would not stop running in her head. 408,250 square kilometers of marine reserve. Fourteen endemic species confirmed extinct. One husband of a woman who was somewhere on this climber, carrying his photograph, preparing to speak his name.

*Teriki Nakibae.* She had looked up the names, finally, in the long years after her departure. She had read the memorial files and the accident reports and the settlement documents. She had learned the faces of the people her calculations had erased.

She had never spoken to any of them. She had never apologized. What words could possibly be adequate?

A passenger brushed past her—a corporate type, champagne in hand, exclaiming to a colleague about investment opportunities in orbital manufacturing. Miriam stepped aside, letting herself fade into the crowd, and wondered if the reef was visible from here.

It wasn't, of course. That was the point of erasure.

---

Yusuf had found a position at the dome's lower edge, where the curve of transparency met the floor and the view tilted downward toward Earth. From here, he could see the tether descending—a line of silver fire stretching toward the planet's surface, toward the anchor city, toward everything he had left behind.

His hand rested on the composite frame, reading vibrations the way he had once read the health of structures he was building. The climber was singing smoothly, its systems in harmony, its ascent steady. His body knew this before his mind registered it—decades of training, of listening for the sounds that meant danger, of keeping himself and his crews alive in environments that wanted them dead.

The dome was crowded. He had watched the passengers arrive—the corporate types with their champagne, the lottery winners with their cameras, the workers who stood apart the way workers always stood apart. He recognized a few faces from the economy deck, people he had nodded to in corridors or sat near in the mess hall. Carlos Reyes was somewhere in the crowd; they had caught each other's eyes and exchanged the small acknowledgment of men who had shared more than this moment.

But Yusuf was not watching the workers. He was watching the premium passengers, the VIPs, the people who moved through this space as if they owned it.

Which, in a sense, they did.

A man in an expensive suit stood near the dome's center, champagne in hand, laughing at something a colleague had said. His face was familiar from the briefing materials Yusuf had studied before boarding—Henrik Lindqvist, CEO of Lindqvist Orbital, board member of the Consortium's economic council. The family that had helped finance the elevator. The family that had profited from every contract, every cargo run, every ticket sold.

Yusuf watched him and felt the old anger stir. This man had never held a wrench in his life. Had never floated in vacuum with nothing between him and death but a pressure suit and a safety line. Had never watched a friend fall because a faulty clamp failed, or received a settlement offer contingent on silence, or been told that the passage he was promised had been "deferred indefinitely."

And yet Henrik Lindqvist was here, champagne in hand, celebrating the achievement of Yusuf's labor as if it were his own.

*This is what they built*, Yusuf thought. *Not the tether. Not the structure. This. The division. The system that puts him up there and me down here, even when we're standing in the same room.*

He turned away from Lindqvist and looked at the view. Earth spread below him, blue and white and impossibly beautiful. Somewhere down there—invisible, absorbed into the city's sprawl—Fatima was going about her morning. The children would be at school by now. Omar would be drawing in his notebook, the same way he drew every day, filling pages with images of the tower his father had built. Nadia would be asking questions, the way she always asked questions, wanting to understand how things worked and why.

He had promised them photographs. He had promised them stories. He had promised he would come back changed, or not changed, or something—he had not known what to promise, because he had not known what this journey would do to him.

Now, looking at the world from above, he began to understand.

The anger was still there. It would always be there—fuel for the rest of his life, the burn that kept him moving when everything said stop. But something else was there too, something he had not expected. The view was doing something to him that the anger could not prevent.

His eyes stung. He blinked, hard, and told himself it was the recycled air.

Through the blur, he saw a woman standing alone near the dome's center. Gray-streaked hair, wrapped in traditional style. Reading glasses pushed up on her forehead. Hands that moved with the particular precision of someone who had spent decades solving problems with their fingers.

He knew that face. He had seen it in photographs, in archived interviews, in the briefing materials the Union had compiled on every major figure associated with the elevator's construction.

Miriam Okonkwo. The architect. The woman who had solved the oscillation problem, whose mathematical insight had made the tether stable, whose name was on the fundamental patents that had made everything possible.

The woman who had designed the system that had exploited him and killed his friends.

She was looking at the Pacific, her expression unreadable. She had not seen him. Perhaps she would not recognize him even if she did—he was nobody, a worker among thousands, a face in no photograph she would have studied.

But he recognized her. And standing there, watching her watch the ocean, Yusuf felt something shift in his chest.

Not forgiveness. Not understanding. Something more complicated than either.

*She's here too*, he thought. *Riding the thing she built. Looking at what it cost.*

He did not approach her. He was not ready. But he noted where she stood, filed the observation away, and returned his attention to the view.

The confrontation would come. But not yet. Not here. When it happened, he wanted words, not a crowd.

---

Zara had escaped her handlers.

It had taken planning—a carefully timed bathroom break, a wrong turn down a service corridor, a maintenance door that led to a secondary elevator bank. The scholarship students were supposed to be experiencing the observation deck as a cohort, accompanied by David and his tablet and his schedule of approved photo opportunities. But Zara had spent her whole life learning to slip through systems designed to contain her, and forty-five minutes of managed wonder was not enough.

Now she stood at the dome's edge, alone for the first time since boarding, and let herself feel what she had not been allowed to feel.

The Earth was below her. All of it. Not a curve, not an angle, not a glimpse through a cabin porthole—the whole visible face of the planet, blue and white and heartbreaking. She could see the Pacific Ocean. She could see weather systems. She could see the thin bright line of atmosphere that was all that separated life from void.

*The physics of this*, she thought, her mind reaching for equations the way it always did. *At this altitude, the gravitational acceleration is approximately 9.1 m/s². The orbital velocity for a circular orbit here would be—*

The calculations wouldn't come. They kept dissolving into the raw fact of what she was seeing, and for once, she didn't try to force them.

Her phone buzzed. She ignored it.

Across the dome, she could see passengers from every section of the climber—the first time, really, that all classes had shared the same space. The VIPs had gravitated toward the center, as if the best view were somehow there rather than distributed equally across 360 degrees of transparency. The workers had claimed the edges, the positions with structural support to lean against, the angles that let them watch the crowd as well as the view. The lottery winners filled the space between, uncertain of where they belonged.

*Spatial dynamics*, Zara thought. *Even here, we sort ourselves.*

She spotted Mei-Lin near the far curve, tablet in hand, probably running calculations. James Peterson was holding court near a group of corporate passengers, his voice carrying even at this distance, explaining something about investment structures. Fatou stood alone by a viewing port, tears streaming down her face, making no move to wipe them away.

And near the center, speaking to no one, an elderly woman in traditional Pacific dress stood watching the ocean.

Zara recognized her immediately. Teiti Nakibae, the I-Kiribati elder who had corrected the death count at yesterday's briefing. Who had said *my name is Teiti Nakibae* like it was a declaration of war. Who had walked away before anyone could manage her message.

The woman was not looking at the view the way the other passengers were looking at it—with wonder, with documentation, with the tourist's hunger to capture and possess. She was looking at a specific point on the planet below, her gaze fixed and searching, her lips moving slightly as if in conversation with someone who wasn't there.

*What is she looking for?*

Zara found herself moving closer, threading through the crowd, drawn by something she couldn't name. The woman didn't notice her approach, or didn't react to it. Her attention was entirely on the ocean below.

From this angle, Zara could see her expression. It was not wonder. It was not grief, exactly. It was something older than either—the look of someone searching for a landmark that no longer existed.

"It's not visible from here," Teiti said, without turning. "The reef. The islands. All of it is gone."

Zara stopped. The woman had known she was there. Had known, perhaps, what she was thinking.

"I'm sorry," Zara said. It was inadequate, but it was what came.

Teiti turned then, her eyes assessing, the same sharp evaluation she had given the briefing presenter when correcting the death toll. "You asked the right question yesterday. About how many died."

"I didn't know the answer."

"No one knows the answer. 1,247 is the count we can document. There were others." She returned her gaze to the ocean. "My husband is down there somewhere. Forty meters under the anchor platform. They never moved the bodies."

Zara felt something cold settle in her chest. "I didn't—I'm sorry, I shouldn't have—"

"You should have." The old woman's voice was steady, almost gentle. "You should ask questions that make people uncomfortable. That is how things change." She paused. "If they change."

"Do you think they can? Change, I mean. From inside."

Teiti was quiet for a long moment. Below them, the Earth turned slowly, carrying its billions of lives through their ordinary days.

"I spent forty years asking that question," she said finally. "I built this elevator with my hands. I organized workers, called strikes, won battles and lost wars. I watched my husband die and my son die and my homeland disappear under concrete." She looked at Zara, and her eyes held something that was neither hope nor despair. "I don't know if things can change from inside. But I know they don't change from outside, either. They change when someone is willing to stand where it costs them something and refuse to be moved."

She turned back to the window, to the ocean, to the place where the reef had been.

"The scholarship," she said. "They're using you for something. You know that."

"Yes."

"Good. As long as you know." She reached out and touched the dome's surface, her weathered palm flat against the transparency. "The question is not whether they use you. The question is what you use them for."

She fell silent, and Zara understood she was dismissed—not unkindly, but completely. The old woman had returned to her vigil, her search for something that was no longer there.

Zara stepped back, her mind full of questions she didn't know how to ask, and let herself be absorbed back into the crowd.

Henrik was having a marvelous time.

The observation deck was everything the brochures promised—the view was spectacular, the champagne was excellent, and the assembled passengers represented precisely the kind of networking opportunity that made voyages like this worthwhile. He had already had productive conversations with a Singaporean shipping magnate, a Brazilian telecommunications executive, and a German politician whose committee oversaw orbital infrastructure funding.

And the view, of course. The view was genuinely extraordinary.

He stood near the dome's center, champagne in hand, and let himself appreciate what his family's investment had helped create. Earth spread below them like a jewel on velvet—blue oceans, white clouds, the thin bright halo of atmosphere. From here, you could see the whole Pacific basin, the curve of the continents, the scale of the world that humanity was preparing to transcend.

*This is what vision looks like*, he thought. *This is what happens when you commit to the impossible.*

His grandfather had seen it first. Back when the elevator was just a physicist's dream and a science fiction trope, Magnus Lindqvist had looked at Yamazaki's early proposals and seen not impossibility but opportunity. He had committed the family fortune when commitment was madness, and now Henrik stood in the result.

The family's orbital holdings were worth forty times what his grandfather had invested. Not bad for two generations of faith.

He spotted one of the scholarship students near the edge of the dome—the British girl, the physicist, the one with the algorithm. Chen-Okafor. She stood alone, watching something he couldn't identify, her expression thoughtful.

Henrik considered approaching her. The Stellar Industries scholarship was partly his company's initiative, and he took a genuine interest in the recipients. These were the young people who would build the next generation of orbital infrastructure—the engineers and scientists who would take humanity from the elevator to the moon to Mars to wherever ambition led. Supporting them was not merely good PR; it was investment in the future.

But something in her posture suggested she didn't want company. He filed the observation away and turned his attention elsewhere.

The view deck was a fascinating social study, if you knew how to read it. The passenger classes were theoretically mixing, sharing the same space for the first time since boarding. But even here, the old patterns persisted. The VIPs had gravitated toward the center, forming clusters of influence and connection. The economy passengers pressed close to the glass, maximizing their access to the view they might never have again. The workers—

Henrik paused. He hadn't noticed the workers before. They stood at the dome's edges, grouped together, their body language different from the other passengers. Not aggressive, exactly. But watchful. Wary.

One of them was looking at him.

A stocky man, middle-aged, with the weathered face and compressed build of someone who had spent years in physical labor. His left hand was missing two fingers. His eyes were dark and unreadable, and they were fixed on Henrik with an intensity that made the champagne taste suddenly flat.

*Who is he?*

The question surfaced and submerged. There were fifty workers aboard, representatives of the labor force that had built the elevator. Henrik knew this abstractly, the way he knew the statistics of any major investment—necessary costs, managed appropriately, documented in quarterly reports. He had never considered that one of them might be watching him.

The man looked away, returning his attention to the view. Henrik felt an odd sensation—not quite guilt, not quite unease, but something that lived in the same territory. The champagne in his hand suddenly seemed inappropriate.

He set the glass on a passing server's tray and moved toward the dome's edge, away from the center, seeking a different perspective.

The view was the same from every angle. Earth below, stars above, the tether stretching between them. But standing here, at the dome's margin, Henrik could see things he hadn't seen from the center. The workers, clustered in their groups. The lottery winners, overwhelmed and uncertain. The scholarship students, performing the roles they'd been assigned.

And below all of them, visible through the transparent floor, the planet that held everyone he had ever known or would ever know.

*It's very small*, he thought. The observation surprised him. He had seen Earth from orbit before, on his cargo inspection trip three years ago. But that had been brief, rushed, filtered through business objectives. He had not stopped to simply look.

Now he looked. And something in the looking unsettled him in ways he could not quite name.

The man with the missing fingers was watching the view now, his face transformed by something that might have been grief or awe or both at once. Henrik watched him watching, and wondered what he saw.

---

Kenji moved through the observation deck with the practiced ease of a man who had spent decades performing in public. Handshake, smile, brief conversation, graceful exit. The rhythm was automatic now—muscle memory built through a thousand receptions, a thousand ribbon-cuttings, a thousand moments when his presence was required to legitimize an achievement.

"Chairman Murakami, what a pleasure—"

"Mr. Chairman, we were just discussing the expansion proposals—"

"Kenji, you must try this champagne—"

He smiled, he nodded, he said the things that were expected. The words emerged without conscious thought, leaving his mind free to do what it had been doing since boarding: scan the crowd for a face he dreaded to find.

*Yusuf Haddad. Jordanian. Former tether assembly specialist. Economy deck, cabin 9.*

The manifest details were burned into his memory. He had read them a hundred times since sending the ticket, memorizing the data as if familiarity might somehow make the coming confrontation less devastating.

Nineteen years. Nineteen years since the site visit, the accident, the four hours trapped together while rescue crews cut through debris. Nineteen years since Yusuf had pulled him to safety, had shown him the reality of construction conditions, had extracted a promise that Kenji had meant with his whole heart.

*I'll fix it. I'll make sure it never happens again.*

He had meant it. He had fought for better conditions, won some battles, lost the war. The system had been larger than his conviction. The compromises had accumulated like interest on a debt he could never repay.

And now Yusuf was aboard, carrying a ticket Kenji had sent without a note, without explanation, without any clear sense of why he had sent it at all.

*Guilt*, he told himself. *You sent it because you're guilty.*

But that wasn't quite right. Guilt didn't require the ticket. Guilt could be carried privately, nursed in the quiet hours before dawn when he lay awake cataloging his failures. The ticket was something else—a summons, perhaps. An invitation to judgment. A hope that seeing Yusuf ascend might mean something, even if Kenji couldn't articulate what.

He reached the dome's edge and paused, letting his public smile fade for a moment. Through the transparency, Earth spread below in its impossible beauty. He had seen this view before, many times—the privilege of his position, the perk of power. But it never stopped affecting him. The thin line of atmosphere, the curve of the horizon, the smallness of everything he had spent his life building and controlling.

*Takeshi would have loved this.* The thought came unbidden. His mentor, his predecessor, his ghost. Takeshi Yamazaki had died before the first public ascent, but he had ridden cargo climbers in the early years, had stood in observation domes not yet open to the public, had looked at Earth from above with the wonder of a man seeing his life's work realized.

What would Takeshi think of what Kenji had done with his legacy?

He knew the answer. He knew it the way he knew his own pulse, his own breath, his own capacity for self-deception. Takeshi would have been disappointed. Not in the compromises themselves—Takeshi had understood compromise, had made his own—but in how easily Kenji had let them accumulate. In how thoroughly he had become what the system needed instead of what the vision required.

A group of passengers drifted past, and Kenji reassembled his public face. Smile, nod, brief acknowledgment. The Chairman being gracious. The Chairman being present. The Chairman performing the role that had consumed him.

Then he saw Yusuf.

The man stood at the dome's lower edge, his hand on the frame, his face turned toward Earth. He was alone—separated from the other workers by some distance, absorbed in whatever he was seeing or thinking or remembering. His missing fingers were visible even at this distance, the damage that had never been adequately compensated, the physical record of a system that treated men as disposable.

Kenji felt his throat tighten. His feet wanted to carry him closer, or carry him away—he wasn't sure which. The moment stretched, elastic with possibility and dread.

*Go to him. Say something. Apologize.*

*For what? For everything? For nineteen years of silence? For the ticket that explains nothing?*

Yusuf turned slightly, his gaze sweeping across the crowd, and their eyes met.

The contact lasted perhaps two seconds. Long enough for recognition. Long enough for Kenji to see something in Yusuf's expression that was not hatred, not forgiveness, not anything he could easily name. Something more complicated. Something that said: *I see you. I know who you are. I know what you owe.*

Then Yusuf looked away, returning his attention to the view, and Kenji found himself breathing again.

*Not yet*, he thought. *The conversation will come. But not yet. Not here.*

He turned away from the dome's edge and moved back toward the center, toward the passengers who expected his attention, toward the performance that was all he had left. Behind him, Yusuf continued to watch the Earth, carrying his questions, waiting for the moment when he would finally ask them.

---

Teiti stood at the dome's western edge, where the view looked out over the Pacific, and searched for something that was no longer there.

The reef had been here, somewhere below her. The Phoenix Islands Protected Area—408,250 square kilometers of pristine ocean, one of the last places on Earth where the marine ecosystem had remained essentially untouched. She had swum these waters as a girl, visiting with her grandfather on a two-day sailing voyage that had felt like traveling to the end of the world. She remembered the shock of clarity when she first put her face beneath the surface: water so transparent it seemed like air, and below her a riot of color and motion that her young mind could not contain.

"The fish are so thick you can walk on their backs," her grandfather had said, and she had not believed him until she saw.

Now the fish were gone. The coral was rubble. The reef that had grown centimeter by centimeter across millennia had been scraped away to make room for a foundation, and her grandfather's fishing grounds were buried under concrete and carbon fiber.

She pressed her palm against the dome's surface and looked down at the ocean that had swallowed her world.

The water was still blue. From this altitude, you could not see the damage. The anchor city appeared as a geometric pattern at the Pacific's center, surrounded by rings of shipping lanes and exclusion zones. The reef was invisible—not hidden, but erased. Transformed into something else entirely.

*This is what they wanted*, she thought. *This is why they put the observation deck at the top. So we look up instead of down. So we see the stars instead of the graves.*

Around her, passengers exclaimed over the view. Cameras clicked. Champagne glasses clinked. The vocabulary of tourism, applied to the place where her husband was buried.

Teriki's photograph was in her bag, pressed against her hip. She had carried it for twenty years—through the construction years and the organizing years and the long years of watching the tower rise while the promises fell. She carried it now, ascending the structure that had killed him, looking for some trace of the water where his body lay.

There was nothing. The reef was gone so completely that its absence left no scar.

*I'm here, Teriki.* She thought the words in Gilbertese, the language they had shared, the language that was dying as surely as the reef. *I'm above the place they buried you. I'm looking for the water your father taught you to read, and I cannot find it.*

A young woman had approached her earlier—the scholarship student who asked questions, the one who might become something or might be consumed by the system that was already using her. Teiti had given her what wisdom she had: *The question is not whether they use you. The question is what you use them for.*

But wisdom felt hollow in a place like this. Wisdom was for the living. The dead wanted only to be remembered.

She found herself mouthing names, barely above a whisper. Not the full ceremony—that would come later, in a proper space, with proper witnesses. But here, now, she could not stand above the grave of her world without speaking to it.

*Teriki. Tebuke. Baiteke. Romulo. Sanjay.*

The names of the anchor collapse. The men who had died in the structure she could now see only as abstraction, a geometric pattern in an ocean that had once been home.

*I'll speak for all of you. In their tower. In their triumph. I'll make them hear.*

The passengers continued their exclamations, their photographs, their champagne. They did not notice the old woman at the dome's edge, speaking to the dead.

But one of them did.

Amara Diallo stood ten meters away, notebook in hand, watching Teiti with the careful attention of someone who recognized a story. Their eyes met briefly. Amara nodded once—not interrupting, not intruding, but acknowledging. *I see what you're doing. I see who you're speaking to.*

Teiti returned the nod and continued her vigil.

The Earth turned below them, carrying its dead and its living toward whatever came next. The reef was gone, but Teiti remained, and she would carry it with her until she no longer could.

---

The observation deck began to empty as the two-hour session neared its end.

Amara had filled seven pages of notes, none of which would appear in her official coverage. She had documented the spatial dynamics—how classes sorted themselves even in shared spaces. She had observed the scholarship students being gathered by their handlers, their free time ending as scheduled. She had watched the workers cluster and disperse, watched Henrik Lindqvist move from center to edge and back again, watched the Chairman of the Consortium scan the crowd with the intensity of a man looking for something he dreaded to find.

And she had watched Teiti Nakibae stand at the dome's western edge for nearly an hour, searching the Pacific for a reef that no longer existed, her lips moving in what might have been prayer or remembrance or both.

*The story*, Amara thought, *is not the view. The story is who's looking and what they see.*

She made a final note: *T.N. at western edge. Searching for Phoenix Islands. Speaking names. The cost of the view deck: $50 billion to build, 1,247 dead, one pristine marine ecosystem destroyed, one culture displaced. The view: equally beautiful for everyone. Equally devastating.*

The last passengers were drifting toward the elevators now, the lottery winners reluctant to leave, the corporate passengers already discussing lunch. Zara Chen-Okafor passed near Amara's position, her expression thoughtful, her eyes finding Teiti one last time before she joined her cohort.

Miriam Okonkwo departed alone, her face unreadable, her gaze lingering on the tether that stretched toward the planet she had helped transform.

Yusuf Haddad moved toward the worker elevator, his damaged hand brushing the dome's surface as he passed, reading vibrations, saying goodbye.

Henrik Lindqvist finished his champagne and handed the glass to a server, his usual smooth confidence slightly dimmed by something Amara couldn't identify. He did not look at the workers as he left.

Kenji Murakami was the last VIP to depart. He stood for a long moment at the dome's center, alone now that his duties were discharged, looking at the Earth with an expression that was almost human. Then he straightened his shoulders, reassembled his public face, and walked toward the elevator as if he were walking toward an execution.

Finally, only Teiti remained.

The old woman stood at the dome's edge, her palm pressed against the transparency, her eyes fixed on the Pacific. Amara hesitated, uncertain whether to approach, whether any question she could ask would be worthy of what she was witnessing.

Then Teiti turned, as if sensing her presence, and their eyes met.

"You're the journalist," Teiti said. "The one who tells stories."

"I try."

"Which story will you tell? Theirs?" She gestured at the elevators, at the departed passengers. "Or ours?"

It was the question Amara had been asking herself for eight years. The question that had driven her coverage of the elevator, her interviews with workers and executives, her careful navigation between access and truth.

"Both," she said. "If I can."

Teiti considered this. Her face, weathered by decades of equatorial sun and loss, gave nothing away.

"Both is hard," she said finally. "Both requires you to hold things that want to destroy each other." She turned back to the view. "But maybe both is the only thing worth telling."

She fell silent, and Amara understood she had received all she would receive. She made one final note—*T.N.: Both is the only thing worth telling*—and turned toward the elevator.

Behind her, Teiti Nakibae remained at the dome's edge, an elder in woven pandanus, watching the ocean where her world had been. The Earth turned below her, beautiful and wounded, carrying its living and its dead.

The view deck emptied. The lights dimmed to standby. And somewhere in the climber's heart, the electromagnetic drive continued its patient pull, carrying five hundred passengers toward a future none of them fully understood.

---

Later, Zara would remember this moment as the first time she truly saw.

Not the Earth—she had seen that since first light, had watched it transform from curve to sphere to the blue marble of every photograph and documentary and scientific visualization. She had calculated orbital mechanics and atmospheric depth and the precise angle at which the sun struck the Pacific to produce the silver shimmer that seemed to extend forever.

But she had not seen the people seeing it. Not until the view deck.

Now, alone in her cabin while her cohort attended another scheduled event, she sat with her tablet and tried to process what she had witnessed. The classes mixing and separating. The workers at the edges. Henrik Lindqvist's champagne and the strange moment when his confidence had flickered. The Chairman scanning the crowd with barely concealed desperation.

And Teiti Nakibae, searching for a reef that was no longer there.

*The question is not whether they use you. The question is what you use them for.*

Zara pulled up the telemetry feed and watched the numbers change: altitude, velocity, structural load. The mathematics of ascent, precise and beautiful.

Then she closed the feed and opened a new document.
