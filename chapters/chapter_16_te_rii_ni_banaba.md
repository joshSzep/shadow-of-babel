# Chapter 16: Te Rii ni Banaba

The storage bay had been transformed.

Teiti stood at the entrance, one hand on the metal doorframe, and felt the change before she saw it. Someone had dimmed the work lamps to amber. Someone had covered the deck plates with woven mats—pandanus, brought from Te Rarawa, the smell of them sharp and green against the recycled air. Someone had pushed the cargo containers to the walls, creating a space at the center. Not large. Not beautiful by the standards of the *maneaba* she remembered from childhood. But sufficient.

Banuera was already there, seated on a mat near the far wall, her back straight despite her sixty-eight years. She looked up as Teiti entered, and something passed between them that did not require words. They had buried husbands in the same collapse. They had wept in the same chapel. They had climbed this same tower.

"The others are coming," Banuera said.

Teiti nodded and lowered herself to the mat beside her friend. The gravity felt wrong—lighter than Earth, though not yet the weightlessness the crew had warned them about. Her knees complained less than they had in years. A small mercy. She wondered if Teriki would have found humor in that: his wife's joints finally at ease, floating toward the stars in a tower built on his grave.

The porthole was small, set high in the wall, but through it she could see Earth. Still large, still close enough to show the curve of the Pacific. Somewhere beneath those clouds, invisible from here, lay the waters where the reef had lived. Where her grandfather had fished. Where she had learned to swim before she learned to walk.

She could not see it. That was the point. That had always been the point.

---

They came in ones and twos, navigating the corridors from bunks and common areas scattered across the economy deck. Binata Eri arrived first after Banuera—the midwife, sixty-four, who had delivered more babies in the shadow of the elevator than she could count. She carried a small bundle wrapped in cloth: ritual items, Teiti knew, though she did not ask what. Some things were between a woman and her practice.

Toorua Kamwea came next, the navigator, his weathered face unreadable as always. He had not navigated by stars in thirty years—there was nowhere left to sail—but he taught the old songs to children in the Workers' Quarter school. The songs remembered what the waters had forgotten.

Kamoriki Tebuke entered with Bauro Timon, the two of them an unlikely pair: Kamoriki who had watched the reef die with his own eyes, and Bauro who led the Congregational Christian Church of Kiribati congregation in Te Rarawa's eastern district. Faith and witness, walking together.

Then Teuea Eritara, who had survived the anchor collapse—who had been pulled from the wreckage with broken ribs and a shattered arm while twenty-three of his brothers had not been pulled out at all. He moved stiffly, as he always had since, and chose a mat near the door as if he might need to leave quickly.

Tokintekai Bureieta arrived with Temakei—Teiti's nephew, Teriki's brother's son, who carried his uncle's face in his own and did not know what a burden that was. Tokintekai was speaking quietly about something—union business, probably; the man could not stop organizing even here, even now—but fell silent as he crossed the threshold.

Nei Teresia came alone.

Teiti watched her enter: forty-seven years old, born in Te Rarawa, daughter of construction workers who had arrived when the city was still scaffolding and promises. She had never seen the old Kiribati. Never swum in waters that were not churned by industrial ships. Never known the reef except as a story her parents told in the dark, their voices heavy with something she could not name.

She was the wound they did not speak of. The inheritance they could not explain.

Tekaai Uera arrived last—the youngest of them at forty-two, a teacher like Toorua, though she taught mathematics rather than navigation. She was breathless, apologetic. "The corridor on Level Three is closed," she said. "I had to go around."

"You are here," Teiti said. "That is enough."

Twelve. All twelve I-Kiribati aboard the maiden voyage. Sitting on pandanus mats in a cargo hold, the stars outside the porthole, the home they had lost invisible beneath clouds.

Teiti looked at each face in turn. Banuera, her sister in grief. Binata, keeper of arrivals. Toorua, keeper of the old ways. Kamoriki, who had seen. Bauro, who believed. Teuea, who had survived. Tokintekai, who fought. Temakei, who carried a dead man's face. Nei Teresia, who carried a dead world's memory. Tekaai, who shaped the next generation.

A span of generations. A remnant of a people. Enough to hold a ceremony. Enough to remember.

"We begin," Teiti said.

---

Binata rose and moved to the center of the space. The others adjusted their positions, forming a rough circle around her—not the precise arrangement of a true *maneaba*, with its designated seating by clan and status, but close enough. Close enough for the ancestors to recognize.

She unwrapped her bundle: a small bowl of seawater, brought from Te Rarawa's harbor. A fragment of coral, bleached white, dead for decades but still shaped like the reef it had once been. A photograph in a worn frame—her grandmother, Teiti knew, who had died on Tarawa before the Compact, before the construction, before everything changed.

Binata held the bowl of seawater and began to chant.

The words were Gilbertese, old Gilbertese, the formal language of ceremony that Teiti's grandmother had spoken and her mother had half-remembered and she herself had learned from recordings in the cultural archive. *Te katei*—the opening, the asking of permission. *We have come to a new place. We ask the ancestors to hear us. We ask the spirits of this place to accept us. We ask forgiveness for what we carry and what we have lost.*

The others joined, those who knew the words. Voices thin in the metal space, swallowed by the hum of the climber's systems, but real. Teiti felt the vibration of the hull beneath her and the vibration of the chant within her, and for a moment they were the same thing: the machine carrying her upward and the song carrying her backward, toward everything that had been.

When the chant ended, Bauro spoke.

"Lord," he said, in Gilbertese still but the Gilbertese of church, of the Congregational tradition that had been on the islands for a hundred and fifty years, "we gather in this place between Earth and Heaven. We carry our dead with us. We carry our grief with us. Be with us now, in this strange place, as you were with us in the waters of our home."

Teiti closed her eyes. The two prayers woven together, as they had been for generations. The old faith and the new faith. The ancestors and the Lord. Her grandmother would have recognized this. Her grandmother's grandmother would not. But faith changed. The need for it did not.

"Amen," said Bauro.

"Amen," said the others.

The seawater caught the amber light. The dead coral gleamed.

---

"I will speak first," Teiti said, "because I am eldest. This is the old way. After me, speak as the spirit moves you."

She did not stand—her knees would not thank her, lighter gravity or not—but she straightened her back and let her voice fill the space.

"I carry Teriki Nakibae," she said. "My husband. Thirty-four years we were married. He worked the anchor construction, the subsea foundation, the hardest and most dangerous labor the Consortium offered. He did it because they promised passage. They promised that the workers who built the tower would ride it to the stars. He believed them."

She paused. The faces around her were still.

"October 17, 2065. The anchor collapse. Teriki was in Section Seven when the cofferdam failed. He was forty-three years old. His body was never recovered. The Consortium paid compensation: enough to bury an empty coffin, not enough to raise our children. They carved his name on a wall and called it memorial."

Her voice did not waver. She had told this story too many times for it to waver.

"I carry Tebuke Nakibae," she said. "My son. He worked the mid-altitude sections, the radiation-heavy zones where the shielding was not what they promised. He was healthy when he started. Six years later, the cancer came. They denied the claim. They said it was unrelated. He died in a hospital in Te Rarawa, looking out the window at the tower that killed him. He was thirty-one years old."

Now her voice wavered. Tebuke was harder. Tebuke had been her son.

"I carry the reef," she said. "I cannot name it, because it has no name—it was simply the water, the life, the world. The fish that were so thick my grandfather said you could walk on their backs. The coral that glowed pink and gold and purple in the shallows. The eels in their caves. The sharks that circled the deeper waters. The turtles that came to nest on the beaches of Kanton. I watched it die. We all watched it die. The dredging and the construction runoff and the thermal discharge from the power plants. Year by year, the color fading. Year by year, the fish fewer. Until there was nothing left but the shape of what had been, and then not even that."

She touched the coral fragment that Binata had placed in the center. Bleached bone of a world.

"I have come to the place they built on our waters," she said. "I have come to witness. This is what I carry."

She fell silent. The hum of the climber filled the space.

---

Banuera spoke next.

"I carry Eritaia Teannaki," she said. "My husband. He was in Section Seven with Teriki. They died together, I think. I hope. I hope they were not alone."

Her voice was quieter than Teiti's, rougher with disuse. Banuera did not speak often, even to her closest friend.

"We were married forty-one years. We had four children. The youngest was seven when he died. She is thirty-three now. She has children of her own. They have never seen the place where their grandfather is buried, because there is no place. Only water, and the tower rising from it."

She stopped. That was all she had. It was enough.

Kamoriki spoke third.

He had been a young man when the construction began—twenty-three, strong, eager for the wages the Consortium offered. He had worked the early phases, the initial dredging, the platform construction, the years when the reef was still alive around the growing footprint of what would become Te Rarawa.

"I watched it die," he said. "That is what I carry. Not a person—the reef. I watched it die."

He described it: the first bleaching event, when the water warmed and the coral expelled its symbiotic algae and turned white as bone. The recovery that followed, partial, hopeful. The second bleaching, worse. The third. The dredging plumes that smothered what remained. The sediment that clouded the water until the sunlight could not reach the bottom. The fish leaving, first the sensitive species, then all of them.

"By the fifth year," he said, "there were no fish in the shallows. By the tenth, no fish at all. I would swim out past the construction barriers, looking. Nothing. Just water and sand and the skeletons of coral. Like a graveyard under the sea."

He stopped. His hands were shaking.

"They said it was necessary," he said. "They said we could not build the future without sacrifice. But they were not the ones who sacrificed. We were. The reef was. The fish were. And now we rise in the tower they built, and the reef is still dead beneath us."

Teuea Eritara spoke next, hesitantly.

"I survived the anchor collapse," he said. "That is what I carry. The survival."

He described it: the rumble of the cofferdam failing, the rush of water, the darkness. His friend pulling him toward an air pocket. The hours of waiting, his arm broken, his ribs cracked, listening to the rescuers work their way closer. The moment they reached him. The moment they told him that Teriki and Eritaia and twenty-one others had not been reached in time.

"I think about it every day," he said. "Why me? Why did I live when they died? I was no better than them. No more deserving. Just luckier. Just closer to the air pocket. Just—"

He stopped. His breath was ragged.

"I should have died with them," he said. "Sometimes I think I did."

No one argued with him. No one offered comfort. This was not a space for comfort. This was a space for speaking what was true.

---

Others spoke. The pattern loosened, voices overlapping, the formal order giving way to something more like conversation.

Tokintekai started to say something about the union negotiations, but Toorua interrupted—not rudely, but as old men do when a thought strikes them—and began humming a navigation chant. The words were ancient, listing stars and currents. Tokintekai fell silent, listening, and when Toorua finished the fragment he simply said: "The same stars. The same songs. We are still navigating."

"And still fighting," Tokintekai added quietly. "Every meter of this tower. Our labor, our blood. 1,247 dead. And now we are guests on it. Lottery winners."

Bauro murmured something about God being with them in the trying, and Binata—who had delivered more babies in Te Rarawa than she could count—said that every child born in the shadow of the elevator was a child of Babel, not I-Kiribati alone, but something new. "I do not know what they will become," she said. "But I helped bring them into the world."

Teiti listened to all of it: the anger and the faith and the uncertain hope. This was how it went in a true *maneaba*—not speeches, but the weaving of voices, each thread necessary, none complete alone.

Temakei had not spoken. Her nephew sat with his head bowed, and Teiti knew why. He looked so much like Teriki that sometimes she had to look away. The same jaw, the same way of holding his shoulders. A dead man's face on a living man's body.

She did not call on him. Some burdens were not ready to be spoken. She caught his eye and nodded once—*I see you, I know what you carry*—and he nodded back, and that was enough.

---

The voices quieted. Teiti looked around the circle and saw that most had spoken, or chosen not to. But one face had not lifted since the ceremony began.

Nei Teresia sat with her hands in her lap, her eyes fixed on the deck plates. Her shoulders were rigid, her breathing shallow.

"Nei Teresia," Teiti said gently. "You do not have to speak. But you are welcome to, if you wish."

For a long moment, nothing. Then Nei Teresia raised her head, and Teiti saw that she was already weeping—not the sudden tears of fresh grief, but the slow seep of something that had been pressing against the walls of her for years.

"I don't know what to carry," she said. "That's the problem. I don't know what I carry."

Her voice was thick, unsteady.

"I was born in Te Rarawa. My parents came when I was an infant—my father worked the mid-altitude sections, my mother worked the processing plants. I grew up in the Workers' Quarter. I went to school there. I married there. My children were born there."

She stopped. Drew a shaking breath.

"I never saw the reef. I never swam in the waters you describe. I never knew the village on Kanton, or Tarawa before the inundation, or any of the places my parents told me about. I carry a homeland I never knew. I mourn what I cannot remember."

Her voice broke.

"Is this still grief?" she asked. "Do I have the right? All of you—you lost something real. Something you held in your hands, something you saw with your eyes. I lost nothing, because I never had it. I only lost the idea of it. The story of it. The—the shape of something I was supposed to have and never did."

She was weeping openly now, her shoulders shaking.

"My parents would describe the reef, and I would try to imagine it, but I couldn't—I couldn't see it, I couldn't feel it, I only knew that it was gone and that I was supposed to mourn it. And I do mourn it. I mourn it every day. But how can you mourn what you never knew? How can you grieve what you only inherited?"

Teiti rose—her knees protesting, the lighter gravity not enough to spare her—and crossed the circle to where Nei Teresia sat. She lowered herself beside the younger woman and took her hands.

"Listen to me," Teiti said. "You carry what we gave you. The stories we told. The grief we could not contain. You are not wrong to mourn. You are not trespassing on our sorrow. You are its inheritor. The carrying is enough. The carrying is everything."

Nei Teresia looked at her—forty-seven years old, born in a city of steel, weeping for a reef she had never seen.

"But I want to remember," she whispered. "I want to have known it. Not just to have been told."

"I know," Teiti said. "I know."

She held Nei Teresia while she wept. The others were silent, witnesses to a grief they recognized but could not share. The grief of the children who came after. The grief of inheritance. The wound that would not close because it had never been opened—only passed down, generation to generation, a shape without a scar.

This was the hardest truth of what they had lost. Not only the dead, not only the reef, not only the waters and the fish and the islands. But the children who would never know what they were mourning. Who would carry the weight without understanding its shape. Who would grieve for a world that was, to them, only a story told in the dark.

Nei Teresia's weeping slowed. Her breath steadied. She did not pull away from Teiti's arms.

"Thank you," she whispered. "Thank you for letting me speak."

"You are Kiribati," Teiti said. "You have always been welcome to speak."

---

Tekaai, the youngest, spoke last.

"I have a question," she said. "Not a burden—a question."

She was a teacher, trained in the methods of inquiry, and even here, even now, she approached with the tools of her trade.

"What do we tell the children? Not our children—they are grown, mostly—but the next generation. The ones who will be born after us, who will only know Te Rarawa, who will never have parents or grandparents who remember the reef. What do we tell them? What do we give them to carry?"

The question hung in the air. No one answered immediately.

"The songs," Toorua said finally. "We give them the songs."

"The faith," Bauro said. "We give them God, who does not change."

"The stories," Binata said. "We give them the stories of who we were."

"The anger," Tokintekai said. "We give them the knowledge of what was done to us. We do not let them forget that this was not natural, not inevitable. That we were wronged."

Teiti listened to each answer. Then she spoke.

"We give them the ceremony," she said. "This. What we are doing now. The gathering, the speaking, the witnessing. We teach them how to hold space for grief, even grief they cannot feel. We teach them that they are part of a people who remember, even when the memories are not their own."

She looked at Nei Teresia, still beside her, face streaked with tears but calmer now.

"We give them permission to mourn," she said. "That is what we give them. The right to grieve what they never knew. The knowledge that inherited grief is still grief. That carrying a weight you did not choose is still carrying."

Tekaai nodded slowly.

"And the hope?" she asked. "Do we give them hope?"

Teiti considered the question. The porthole showed Earth, blue and clouded, the Pacific invisible beneath the weather. Stars beyond.

"We give them the stars," she said. "Toorua's stars. The same stars our ancestors navigated by. We are still navigating. We do not know where we are going, but we are going there together. That is the hope. Not that things will be better, but that we will still be Kiribati when we arrive. Whatever we arrive at. Wherever we are going."

Silence. Then Toorua began to sing.

---

It was a navigation song—old, older than memory, passed down through generations of voyagers who had crossed the Pacific in canoes, reading the stars and the currents and the flight of birds. The melody was simple, the words complex: lists of stars and their positions, lists of currents and their directions, lists of islands and the signs that marked their approach.

Others joined. Not all of them knew the words—the younger ones, especially, had only fragments—but they hummed the melody, adding their voices to the song. The sound filled the storage bay, thin against the metal walls, absorbed by the cargo containers, but real. Present. Alive.

Teiti did not sing. She listened. She watched.

Twelve I-Kiribati, floating toward the stars in a tower built on their waters. Singing a song their ancestors had sung when they crossed the same ocean in canoes. The stars had not changed. The song had not changed. Only the vessel was different. Only the destination.

Through the porthole, Earth turned slowly. The Pacific moved in and out of view, blue and vast, its surface wrinkled with clouds. Somewhere down there, invisible, the waters where the reef had lived. The place that was no longer a place. The home that was no longer a home.

They could not go back. There was nothing to go back to. But they could carry it with them, the memory and the grief and the songs, and they could pass it to their children, and their children's children, until it became what Nei Teresia had inherited: a story told in the dark, a weight without a shape, a grief for something never known.

The song ended. Silence returned.

Teiti spoke the closing words.

"We have gathered," she said. "We have spoken. The walls have heard us. The stars have heard us. The ancestors have heard us."

She paused. The faces around her were still, attentive, waiting.

"We do not leave our grief here," she said. "We carry it with us. Tomorrow, when we wake, the grief will still be there. Next year it will still be there. It does not get lighter. We do not heal; we endure. And we endure together."

She looked at each face in turn—the elders who remembered, the younger ones who carried what they had been given.

"Go now," she said. "Rest. Tomorrow we rise higher. Tomorrow we are further from the waters where our people lived. But we are still Kiribati. We are still here. And we will still be here when we reach the top of this tower, and when we descend again, and when our children's children's children are dust. We will still be here. That is what it means to be a people. That is what it means to carry."

The ceremony did not end with resolution. It ended with acknowledgment. The grief remained. The loss remained. But it had been spoken, and speaking was the first form of carrying.

---

The others rose slowly, reluctantly. They gathered their belongings—the mats would stay, left for others who might need this space—and drifted toward the door. Quiet words of farewell, hands clasped, embraces offered and accepted.

Nei Teresia paused before Teiti.

"Thank you," she said again. "For holding me. For saying I was allowed."

"You are always allowed," Teiti said. "You are my people. All of you. Always."

Nei Teresia nodded and slipped out into the corridor.

Banuera stayed. She would stay—she always stayed, after the ceremonies, the funerals, the moments when Teiti needed someone beside her but could not ask. Banuera knew without asking. That was the gift of forty years of friendship, of shared grief, of walking the same path.

"It was good," Banuera said. "They needed it."

"We all needed it."

"Yes." Banuera looked at the porthole. "Do you think they heard us? The ones above, in their reception halls, drinking their champagne?"

"No," Teiti said. "They did not hear us. That is not why we speak."

"Why do we speak, then?"

Teiti considered the question. The porthole showed Earth, blue and white, the clouds shifting over the Pacific. Somewhere beneath those clouds, invisible from here, the waters where Teriki's body rested. Where Tebuke's ashes had been scattered. Where the reef had lived and died.

"We speak so that we hear ourselves," she said. "We speak so that the dead know they are not forgotten. We speak so that our children know what to carry, and our children's children, and all the generations after. We speak because speaking is the only ritual that survives everything—war, colonization, displacement, death. They can take our land and our water and our reef. They cannot take our voices. They cannot stop us from naming what was lost."

Banuera nodded slowly.

"The ones above will never know," she said.

"No. And that is their loss, not ours."

They sat in silence for a while, two old women on a mat of woven pandanus, floating toward the stars in a tower of carbon and steel. The hum of the climber's systems surrounded them, constant and indifferent. The porthole showed the curve of Earth, the blue of the ocean, the white of the clouds.

Teiti thought of Teriki. Not his death—she had thought enough of his death, spoken enough of his death, carried enough of his death for twenty years. She thought of his life. The way he laughed. The way he held their children. The way he came home from work, exhausted, coated in salt and grime, and still found the energy to tell her about his day. The small things. The human things. The things that were harder to carry than grief, because grief was public and honored, but love was private and easily forgotten.

"I miss him," she said. "Not the martyr. Not the name on the wall. Him. The man who snored and burned the rice and taught our son to fish."

"I know," Banuera said. "I miss Eritaia the same way. The living man, not the dead symbol."

"They deserve to be remembered as they were. Not as what they became."

"Yes."

Teiti rose, slowly, her knees protesting despite the lighter gravity. She walked to the porthole and pressed her palm against the cold metal of the hull. The vibration of the climber hummed through her hand—the engines, the magnetic systems, the vast machinery lifting them toward the stars.

Her husband had helped build this. Her people's waters were beneath it. And she rose, carrying all of it, into the dark.

"It is time to sleep," she said. "Tomorrow we rise higher."

"Tomorrow," Banuera agreed.

They left the storage bay together, two old women walking slowly through the corridors of the climber, past the closed doors of bunks where workers and lottery winners and the twelve I-Kiribati of the maiden voyage were settling into sleep. The lights were dimmed for the artificial night cycle. The hum of the systems was the only sound.

Teiti paused at the junction where their paths diverged—Banuera's bunk to the left, hers to the right.

"Thank you," she said. "For staying."

"I always stay," Banuera said. "You know this."

"I know. Thank you anyway."

Banuera touched her hand, briefly, and turned away.

Teiti walked the final corridor alone. Her bunk was small, a capsule barely large enough to lie down in, with a slot for her bag and a tiny screen for communications. But it had a porthole. She had requested that specifically. A porthole facing down, toward Earth.

She lay on the narrow bed and looked through the small circle of glass. Earth was there, vast and blue, the Pacific a dark mirror reflecting nothing. Somewhere down there, beneath the clouds, beneath the water, the reef slept its endless sleep. The fish that had been so thick you could walk on their backs. The coral that had glowed pink and gold and purple. The eels and the sharks and the turtles. All of it gone, and gone, and gone.

She pulled the photograph of Teriki from her bag and set it beside her, propped against the wall where she could see it.

"I ascended the tower built on your grave," she told him. "I spoke your name in a place you were denied. I will carry you home."

The photograph did not answer. It never answered. But she spoke to it anyway, because speaking was the ritual that survived everything, and Teriki was the name she would never stop speaking.

Outside the porthole, Earth turned.

Inside the climber, Teiti Nakibae closed her eyes and let the hum of the machines carry her toward sleep. Tomorrow they would rise higher. Tomorrow the Pacific would be smaller, the home further away. But she would still be Kiribati. She would still be here.

And she would carry what she carried, as her people had always carried, until the carrying itself became the song.
