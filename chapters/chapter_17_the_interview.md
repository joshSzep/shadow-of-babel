# Chapter 17: The Interview

The press room was quiet in the way that professional spaces became quiet—not silence, but the managed absence of distraction. Amara had arrived twenty minutes early, as she always did, arranging the space the way she liked it: her chair angled to catch the subject's face in the port's reflected light, her tablet propped at exactly the distance where she could glance at notes without breaking eye contact, her backup recorder positioned on the fold-down table between them.

The room was small—thirty square meters shared among fifteen journalists, though most were filing from their cabins at this hour or chasing interviews in the observation decks. She had claimed the corner station, the one with the narrow window that showed a sliver of Earth's curve against black. Not much of a view, but enough to remind her where she was. Where they all were.

She reviewed her notes one more time.

*Zara Chen-Okafor, 22. British. Imperial College London, physics. Working-class background—parents run a restaurant in Hackney. Scholarship recipient, Stellar Foundation. Algorithm contribution to oscillation dampening system—her work is literally in the tether. Talking points provided by Foundation PR: inspiration, opportunity, gratitude, future. Approved topics: her research, the view, the cohort experience. Discouraged topics: labor conditions, access inequality, ticket allocation policies.*

The list of discouraged topics was longer than the approved ones. It always was.

A soft chime from the corridor. Amara straightened in her chair, arranged her expression into professional warmth, and waited for the door to open.

---

Zara Chen-Okafor entered the press room the way she probably entered most rooms: alert, cataloging, already calculating the dynamics before she'd fully arrived. She wore the scholarship cohort's standard attire—practical but presentable, the Stellar Foundation logo small and tasteful on her collar—and her natural hair was twisted back in a style that suggested both practicality and intention.

She was young. That was the first thing Amara noticed, though she'd known the age from the file. Twenty-two looked younger in person than it did in briefing documents. But there was something in Zara's eyes that wasn't young at all—a particular quality of attention that Amara recognized from mirrors, from colleagues who had lasted in journalism long enough to develop it.

*She's assessing me,* Amara thought. *The same way I'm assessing her.*

"Ms. Chen-Okafor." Amara rose and extended her hand. "Thank you for making time. I know your schedule is quite full."

"It is." Zara's handshake was firm, brief, calibrated. "But the Foundation thought this interview was important." A beat. "They told me you were the journalist to impress."

"Did they."

"Something about your reach. Your credibility. Your history with the elevator coverage." Zara settled into the chair across from Amara, her posture professional but not rigid. "They didn't mention that you've been covering the labor controversies for eight years. Or that you've interviewed worker representatives who weren't supposed to be interviewed. I had to look that up myself."

Amara felt something shift in her chest—interest, recognition, the small spark that happened when a subject turned out to be more than their talking points.

"You did your research."

"I always do." Zara's gaze moved briefly to the window, to the sliver of Earth visible through the narrow port. "I'm a physicist. Research is the whole point."

"And what did your research tell you about this interview?"

"That you'll ask me the approved questions first. Build rapport. Make me comfortable." Zara looked back at her, direct and unblinking. "And then you'll ask me something real, and I'll have to decide whether to answer it."

Amara let the silence stretch for a moment. In twenty-three years of journalism, she had developed a sense for when to push and when to wait. This felt like a waiting moment.

"That's quite an assumption," she said finally.

"Is it wrong?"

"No." Amara picked up her tablet, not to read from it but to have something to do with her hands. "It's not wrong at all."

---

The official interview began the way official interviews always began.

"Tell me about the moment you learned you'd received the scholarship."

Zara smiled—the practiced smile, the one Amara had seen in the PR photographs. "I was in my flat in Hackney. Shared housing, four students, not much space. My mother called before the letter arrived—she'd seen something on social media, a leak from someone in the Foundation. She was crying before I even knew what had happened."

"And what did you feel?"

"Shock, mostly. I'd applied because my advisor said I should, not because I thought I'd get it. The odds were—" She paused, calculating. "There were over forty thousand applicants for twelve positions. The probability was 0.03 percent."

"But you beat those odds."

"I did." The practiced smile flickered, something more complicated showing through. "Or the odds were never really random. I had the right profile—working-class background, minority heritage, strong academic record, research that was actually useful to the program. I checked the boxes they wanted to check."

Amara made a note, though she didn't need to. The answer was already more interesting than the talking points had prepared her for.

"You sound ambivalent about that."

"Do I?" Zara's expression recalibrated—not hiding, exactly, but becoming more careful. "I'm grateful for the opportunity. It's opened doors I couldn't have opened myself. That's what I'm supposed to say, and it's also true."

"But?"

"But nothing. I'm here. I'm ascending the elevator my algorithm helped stabilize. I'm seeing Earth from space." She gestured at the window. "What's there to be ambivalent about?"

It was a good deflection. Amara recognized it—she used similar moves herself, when interviews went places she didn't want to follow. But she also recognized the thing beneath the deflection, the tension that Zara was managing rather than resolving.

*She's navigating the same maze I am,* Amara thought. *Different entrance, same walls.*

"Let's talk about your research," she said, shifting to safer ground. "The oscillation dampening algorithm. Can you explain it for a general audience?"

Zara's face changed—the caution easing, something more genuine emerging. This was territory she knew, territory where her expertise was unambiguous.

"The tether isn't rigid," she said. "It's a ribbon, essentially—carbon composite, incredibly strong, but also flexible. When you run a climber up it, you introduce oscillations. The ribbon wants to vibrate, like a guitar string. At certain frequencies, those vibrations can amplify—resonate—and potentially cause structural failure."

"And your algorithm prevents that?"

"It predicts the resonance patterns and adjusts the climber's velocity and electromagnetic engagement to dampen them before they become dangerous. It's a feedback system—the climber reads the tether's behavior and responds in real-time." She paused. "The math is elegant. The implementation is complicated. But the basic principle is simple: listen to the structure, respond to what it tells you."

"Listen to the structure," Amara repeated. "That's a poetic way to describe engineering."

"Engineering is poetry. At least, the good kind is." Zara's expression flickered again—something wistful, or maybe just honest. "My work is in there, somewhere. In the climber's systems, in the way it moves. I can feel it when we accelerate, when the drive adjusts. It's like—" She stopped.

"Like what?"

"Like hearing a song you wrote, played by someone else. Recognizing it and not recognizing it at the same time."

Amara wrote the quote down. It was good material—the kind of line that would make the feature package sing. She could already see how it would play: *Young Physicist Hears Her Algorithm in the Stars*. Inspirational. Aspirational. Exactly what the Foundation wanted.

But she was more interested in the silence that followed—the way Zara looked at the window, her expression shifting into something the cameras wouldn't capture.

"Can I ask you something off the record?"

Zara turned back to her. "That depends on what you're asking."

"Nothing dramatic. Just—" Amara set her tablet down, a deliberate gesture. "How does it feel to be here? Not the talking-points version. The real version."

The silence stretched. Zara's hand went to her glasses, pushing them up her nose—a gesture that was probably unconscious, probably something she'd been doing since childhood. For a moment she looked less like a scholarship recipient being interviewed and more like someone's daughter, someone's student, someone who was twenty-two years old and very far from home.

Amara could see her calculating—weighing risks, assessing intentions, deciding whether this journalist was the kind who could be trusted with something true.

"You know that game," Zara said finally, "where you try to hold two contradictory thoughts in your mind at the same time? Be grateful and resentful. Feel like you earned something and like you were selected for it. Believe in the system and see through it."

"I know that game."

"That's how it feels." Zara's voice was quieter now, the professional polish stripped back. "Every minute of every day. The view is—I don't have words for the view. It changes everything. And at the same time, I know exactly how many people entered the lottery and didn't get seats. I know the workers who were promised passage and never received it. I know the families of the dead."

"The 1,247."

Zara looked at her sharply. "You know that number."

"I've been covering this story for eight years. I know a lot of numbers." Amara leaned back slightly, letting the conversation breathe. "I also know that the official count is 847, and the difference is not accidental."

"There was a woman," Zara said. "At our educational briefing. She walked in and corrected the presenter. Said her name was Teiti Nakibae. Said her husband was one of the dead they don't count."

"I know who she is." Amara's voice was careful now, treading on ground that mattered. "I've been trying to interview her since before boarding."

"She said something to me. At the observation deck." Zara's gaze drifted to the window again, to the Earth that contained everything they'd left behind. "She said the question isn't whether they use you. The question is what you use them for."

Amara felt the words land in her chest—the particular weight of truth spoken by someone who had earned the right to speak it.

"That's a hard question to answer."

"I know. I've been trying to answer it since she said it." Zara looked back at her, and something had changed in her expression—a decision made, a door opened. "What are you going to do with this interview, Ms. Diallo?"

"Amara."

"Amara." Zara tested the name. "What are you going to do with it?"

"The official version? File a feature on the scholarship program. Inspirational young physicist, diversity in action, the future of space. The Foundation will be pleased. My editors will be pleased. Everyone will be pleased."

"And the unofficial version?"

Amara was quiet for a moment. The press room hummed around them—the ventilation, the distant pulse of the climber's systems, the vast machinery of the ascent. Through the narrow window, Earth curved blue and white against endless dark.

"I've been covering this story since the first anchor went in," she said finally. "I've watched the narrative get managed. I've seen what gets reported and what doesn't. I've interviewed workers in hospital rooms who were afraid to speak on the record. I've filed stories that got edited down to nothing because they made the wrong people uncomfortable."

"That sounds like frustration."

"It is frustration. It's also—" She paused, searching for the word. "Complicity. I keep my access by not pushing too hard. I tell partial truths and call it journalism. I write features about scholarship students while the workers who built this thing are still waiting for the passage they were promised."

Zara was watching her with that assessing gaze, the one that had cataloged the room when she entered.

"You're being very honest with me," she said. "For an on-the-record conversation."

"We went off the record five minutes ago."

"Did we?" Zara smiled—a real smile, not the practiced one. "I must have missed that."

"I'm turning it back on now." Amara picked up her tablet, the gesture deliberate. "Unless you'd rather I didn't."

"No." Zara straightened in her chair, her expression settling into something that was careful and true at the same time. "No, I think I'm ready to be on the record."

---

They talked for another forty minutes.

Amara asked the approved questions—about the cohort experience, the view, the future of orbital research, the importance of accessible space. Zara answered them well, with the polish she'd been trained to deliver and something else underneath, something that kept breaking through like light through cloud cover.

She talked about her parents' restaurant, about the hours they worked so she could study, about the way her father had looked when she told him she'd be going to space. She talked about her brother Marcus, sixteen and hungry for technical details, demanding photographs of engineering systems he would never see in person. She talked about the scholarship cohort—the bonds they'd formed, the competitions they navigated, the shared awareness that they were being used and the shared determination to use the opportunity anyway.

And then, near the end, she talked about the workers.

"I met some of them," she said. "In the common areas, during open observation hours. They don't talk much, but when they do—" She paused. "There's a man, I think his name is Yusuf. He built this. With his hands. Spent years up here, risking his life, and they promised him passage that took decades to deliver. He looks at this structure the way I look at my equations—like he can see what's behind the surface, what it cost to make it real."

"Have you spoken with him?"

"No. I don't think I'd know what to say." Zara looked at her hands, at the fingers that had typed algorithms into computers but never gripped a welding torch or a safety line. "What do you say to someone who made the thing that made your career possible? 'Thank you' seems inadequate. 'Sorry' seems worse."

"Maybe you say nothing. Maybe you just see them."

"Is that enough?"

Amara thought about Teiti Nakibae, standing at the edge of the observation deck, searching for a reef that no longer existed. She thought about the 1,247 names that would never appear on tickets. She thought about her own daughter, watching from Paris, asking when her mother would come home.

"I don't know," she said honestly. "I've been asking myself that question for eight years. I still don't have an answer."

---

The interview ended the way interviews ended—with handshakes and thank-yous and the mutual acknowledgment that something had happened, even if neither of them was quite sure what.

"The feature will run in two days," Amara said, gathering her equipment. "Standard approval process through the Foundation. They'll want to review it before publication."

"I know the process." Zara was standing by the door, her posture different than when she'd entered—less guarded, more uncertain, like someone who had said more than she'd planned to. "Will they cut the parts about the workers?"

"Probably. They usually do."

"And you'll let them?"

The question was direct, the way Zara's questions tended to be. Amara felt it land—the challenge, the invitation, the test.

"The feature, yes. That's the price of access." She paused, choosing her words carefully. "But features aren't the only kind of story I know how to tell."

Zara looked at her for a long moment—that assessing gaze, the physicist's attention to data. "You're planning something."

"I'm always planning something. It's an occupational hazard."

"Something bigger than a feature."

"Maybe." Amara slung her bag over her shoulder, feeling the weight of the equipment, the recordings, the notes that would become something she hadn't fully shaped yet. "I've spent eight years building a file. Worker testimony. Consortium documents. The real numbers, the ones they don't publish. I've been waiting for the right moment to do something with it."

"And is this the right moment?"

"I don't know yet. But I'm getting closer to knowing."

Zara nodded slowly. There was something in her expression that Amara recognized—the particular look of someone deciding to trust, or at least to risk trusting.

"If you're ever looking for someone to help," Zara said, "with whatever you're planning. Someone with access to different parts of the system. Different kinds of information."

"Are you offering?"

"I'm—considering it." Zara smiled, a small thing, genuine. "The question isn't whether they use you. The question is what you use them for. I'm still figuring out my answer. But I think I'm starting to understand the question."

She opened the door and paused at the threshold, looking back.

"Thank you," she said. "For asking something real."

"Thank you for answering."

And then she was gone, her footsteps fading down the corridor, and Amara was alone in the press room with her recordings and her notes and the sliver of Earth visible through the narrow window.

---

She sat for a long time after Zara left, not writing, not reviewing, just thinking.

The interview had been good—good enough to satisfy the Foundation, good enough to file as the inspirational feature her editors expected. Zara Chen-Okafor, scholarship student, physicist, the face of access and opportunity, rising toward the stars on the strength of her merit and the Foundation's generosity.

That story was true. It was also incomplete.

The other story—the one that lived in the silences, in the questions Zara had asked, in the names she'd mentioned and the workers she'd noticed—that story was harder to tell. It required more than forty minutes in a press room. It required trust built over time, sources developed and protected, the slow accumulation of evidence that could survive the Consortium's attempts to manage it into irrelevance.

Amara pulled up her encrypted files—the ones she'd been building for eight years. Worker testimony. Medical records. Interviews with families of the dead.

She added today's recording to the archive and opened a new document.

---

That evening, Amara called Aïssatou.

Her daughter's face appeared on the screen—bright, impatient, full of the particular energy of eight-year-olds who have been waiting too long for something they were promised.

"Mama! You said you'd call earlier!"

"I know, ma petite. I had an interview that ran long."

"Was it boring?"

"No." Amara smiled, feeling some of the day's tension ease at the sight of her daughter's face. "No, it wasn't boring at all."

"Did you see the Earth today? Is it smaller?"

"It's smaller. I'll send you a picture."

"Send me a video! I want to see it moving!"

"I'll try."

Behind Aïssatou, Amara could see the familiar walls of their Paris apartment—the bookshelf with its jumble of languages, the window that looked out on a courtyard, the life she'd built between assignments and deadlines and the constant pull of stories that needed telling.

"Mama," Aïssatou said, her voice shifting into something more serious. "Grandmère called again."

Amara felt her chest tighten. "What did she say?"

"She said she's proud of you. And that you should come home when you can."

"I will. Soon."

"That's what you always say."

"I know." Amara looked at her daughter's face, at the child who was growing up in fragments, in video calls and visits between assignments, in the spaces she carved out from work that never seemed to end. "I know I always say that. But this time—"

"This time what?"

"This time I mean it more."

Aïssatou studied her with the particular perception of children who have learned to read their parents' silences. "You sound different, Mama."

"Do I?"

"Sadder. Or maybe—" She paused, searching for the word. "Clearer. Like you figured something out."

*Out of the mouths of babes,* Amara thought. *The truth spoken simply.*

"Maybe I did figure something out," she said. "Maybe I'm still figuring it."

"That's okay." Aïssatou smiled, the quick bright smile that always undid Amara, no matter how far away she was. "You're smart. You'll get there."

"Thank you, ma petite."

"I love you, Mama."

"I love you too. More than the stars."

The call ended, and Amara sat in the press room with the Earth turning slowly in the window, thinking about daughters and mothers and the stories they inherited. About Teiti Nakibae, who had lost a husband and a son and a homeland and was still standing. About Zara Chen-Okafor, who was twenty-two and already learning to hold contradictions. About herself, forty years old next month, still trying to figure out what kind of journalist she wanted to be.

*The question isn't whether they use you. The question is what you use them for.*

She thought about her file—the eight years of documentation, the testimony and evidence, the story waiting to be told. She thought about Zara's offer, careful and genuine, to help with whatever came next. She thought about the feature she would write and the story she would hold back, and whether holding back was the same as betrayal.

Through the window, the Earth was smaller than it had been that morning. By tomorrow it would be smaller still. In a week, she would be in orbit, looking down at the whole blue marble, and the story would still be waiting.

But now she knew something she hadn't known before.

She wasn't the only one asking the question. She wasn't the only one looking for the answer. And somewhere on this climber, in scholarship quarters and workers' sections and the observation decks where all classes briefly mixed, other people were asking the same thing.

*What do you use them for?*

Amara opened her document and began to write. Not the feature—that could wait. Something else. Something that might, eventually, become the story she'd been building toward for eight years—the one that could hold both truths at once, the awe and the shadow.

She wrote until the artificial night cycle dimmed the lights, and then she wrote some more. Not the story she'd been assigned. The one she'd been carrying.

Outside the narrow window, the stars burned steadily against the endless dark.
