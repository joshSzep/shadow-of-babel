## Physical Presence

Thomas Whitmore looks like what he was raised to be: a Southern preacher. Tall, broad-shouldered, with a presence that fills rooms. Silver hair swept back from a weathered face, deep-set blue eyes that project certainty and compassion in equal measure. His voice is his instrument—a rich baritone trained in the call-and-response of Baptist tradition, capable of dropping to intimacy or rising to thunder.

He dresses simply now: dark suits without ostentation, a silver pin on his lapel shaped like an upward arrow—the Church's symbol. No robes, no regalia. He learned that humility performs better than grandeur in the media age.

His hands are large, expressive, constantly in motion when he speaks. He touches people—shoulders, hands, arms—with practiced warmth. His smile is beatific and, to skeptics, unsettling.

## Background

### Early Life
Born in Huntsville, Alabama, 2018, in the shadow of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. His father was a rocket engineer; his mother was a church organist. He grew up believing that God and rockets were not in conflict—that reaching for heaven was humanity's calling, whether through prayer or propulsion.

Called to ministry at sixteen. Attended seminary in Louisville. Ordained Baptist at twenty-four. Served small churches throughout Alabama and Tennessee for two decades, watching his congregations age and shrink.

### The Crisis and Transformation (2055–2065)
By his late forties, Thomas was burning out. The old certainties felt hollow; the traditional church was dying; he'd begun to doubt not God but the forms through which God was worshipped. The climate disasters, the social upheavals, the sense that humanity was lost—he fell into depression, nearly left ministry.

Then the Consortium announced the elevator project. Thomas watched the first tether tests and wept. He felt—he will tell you he *knew*—that this was God's next covenant. Babel was being rebuilt, but this time with divine blessing. Humanity's reach for the heavens was not hubris but calling.

### Founding the Church of the Ascent (2065–2085)
He left the Baptist convention and founded a new movement. The theology was syncretistic: Christian framework, but open to all faiths who recognized the sacred dimension of space. The elevator was a sacrament. Ascent was pilgrimage. The view of Earth from above was revelation.

The Church grew—first among displaced evangelicals seeking new meaning, then among the spiritual-but-not-religious, then globally. By 2085, the Church of the Ascent claims 12 million members worldwide. Thomas is their prophet, their pastor, their public face.

## Psychology

### Core Trait: Genuine Faith
Thomas believes. This is not performance or grift—he truly experiences the elevator as sacred, the ascent as spiritual transformation. His faith is the foundation of everything he's built. Critics who assume cynicism miss the point: he's more dangerous because he's sincere.

### The Prophet's Burden
He's become more than he intended. Millions look to him for meaning. Every word he speaks is parsed for doctrine. He's aware that the movement has grown beyond his control—factions, interpretations, extremists who take his metaphors literally. He lies awake wondering if he's led people toward truth or away from it.

### Theological Flexibility
His theology has evolved to maintain relevance. Early sermons were more traditionally Christian; now he speaks in broader terms—"the sacred," "transcendence," "cosmic purpose." He tells himself this is spiritual maturity. Sometimes he wonders if it's just marketing.

### The Hunger for the Experience
Thomas has never ascended. The Church has requested tickets for years; the Consortium has declined, wary of the optics. He's preached about ascent as revelation without experiencing it himself. The maiden voyage invitation is his chance to finally witness what he's been prophesying. He's terrified it won't live up to his promises—and terrified it will.

## The Church of the Ascent

### Core Beliefs
- The elevator is a sacred structure, humanity's covenant with the cosmos
- Ascent is spiritual transformation, not just physical travel
- The "overview effect" (seeing Earth from space) is divine revelation
- All humanity has a right to this experience—access is a moral imperative
- The builders of the elevator are sacred laborers, regardless of the Consortium's treatment

### Practices
- "Groundings": meditation services facing upward, toward the tether's direction
- Pilgrimage to Te Rarawa (the anchor city) as holy site
- Reading of "Ascent Scriptures"—collected testimonies of those who've experienced orbit
- Tithing toward the "Universal Access Fund"—lobbying for democratized passage

### Controversies
- Critics call it a cult; Thomas calls it a movement
- Some members have died attempting unauthorized tether climbs
- Accused of exploiting spiritual seekers and the climate-traumatized
- Unclear financial structures and governance
- Tension between Thomas's moderate leadership and extremist factions

## Key Relationships

### With the Consortium
Complicated. The Church's access advocacy threatens their business model, but the Church also sacralizes their product. Director Nakamura has cultivated Thomas carefully—the invitation to the maiden voyage is part of that cultivation. Thomas knows he's being managed; he's decided to accept management in exchange for access.

### With His Followers
He loves them and fears for them. He knows some have built their entire lives around his words. The responsibility is crushing. He tries to preach doubt alongside faith—"I am not the answer; the ascent is the question"—but prophets rarely control their reception.

### With Yusuf (POV Character)
The Church honors the builders as sacred laborers. If Thomas learns Yusuf is aboard, he might seek him out—to witness, to bless, to understand. Yusuf might find this offensive or oddly comforting. The encounter could be charged.

### With Miriam (POV Character)
Thomas considers the architects near-divine figures. Miriam might find his veneration uncomfortable—she knows the compromises behind the miracle. A conversation between them could explore the gap between what the elevator means and what it cost.

## The Maiden Voyage

### Why He's Here
This is pilgrimage. After twenty years of preaching about ascent, he will finally experience it. Every sermon, every doctrine, every promise will be tested against reality. He's simultaneously exhilarated and terrified.

### His Plans
- Witness everything with theological attention
- Take notes for future sermons and scriptures
- Seek out the "sacred moments"—first view of curvature, crossing into space, the overview
- Connect with other passengers as potential ministry
- Document the experience for his followers on Earth

### What He's Afraid Of
- That the experience will be mundane, not transcendent
- That he'll see the shadow too clearly—the inequality, the exploitation
- That his theology will crack under the weight of reality
- That he's been wrong all along

### What He Hopes
- Confirmation. Revelation. The experience that makes everything worthwhile.
- A message to bring back that will sustain his movement for generations
- Personal transformation—becoming what he's preached

## Voice and Manner

Thomas speaks in rhythms—the cadence of Southern preaching, softened for broader audiences. He builds sentences like hymns, with crescendos and diminuendos. He's quotable by instinct; decades of sermons have trained him to produce aphorisms.

In private, he's more hesitant. The certainty wavers. He asks questions instead of answering them. He admits doubt to those he trusts—which is almost no one.

**Sample speech patterns:**

Public sermon: "They called it Babel as a warning. But we hear it as a promise. The first Babel fell because humanity reached in arrogance. This Babel rises because humanity reaches in wonder. And wonder, friends—wonder is the beginning of wisdom."

To a skeptic: "I don't ask you to believe what I believe. I ask you to look up. Just look up. And when you're ready, look down—at this fragile world from the perspective of the stars. Then tell me what you see. I'll be listening."

Private doubt (rare): "What if it's just... a train? An expensive train to an expensive destination? What if I've built a religion around an engineering project? What if the people who trusted me were better off without my meaning-making?"

To Yusuf (if they meet): "You built this with your hands. Do you know what that means? The cathedrals of Europe—the workers who carved the stones, who mixed the mortar—they were anonymous. History forgot them. But you, brother—you built the cathedral that touches heaven. I want to hear your story. All of it."

## Arc Potential

Thomas's journey might be:

**Beginning:** The prophet approaching his holy site, faith intact, hope high

**Middle:** The experience is profound—but he also sees the inequality, the access restrictions, the gap between his theology of universal ascent and the reality of 500 chosen passengers. His faith is tested not by absence of transcendence but by presence of injustice.

**End:** He might emerge with faith deepened and complicated. He might find new direction for his movement—toward access activism, toward acknowledging the shadow alongside the awe. He might privately crack while publicly maintaining the prophet's face. The voyage won't give him easy answers.

## Thematic Function

Thomas represents **meaning-making**—the human need to find the sacred in the monumental. Through him, the novel can explore:

- What does the elevator mean beyond its function?
- Can genuine faith coexist with exploitation of that faith?
- The role of religion in responding to technological transformation
- The gap between spiritual experience and institutional religion
- American evangelical reinvention in the 21st century

He's neither fraud nor saint. He's a man who found meaning and built a movement, now confronting whether that meaning survives contact with reality.

## Notes for Writers

- Thomas should appear in observation deck scenes—he's seeking the revelatory view
- His interactions with secular characters create productive friction
- He's a potential ally for access reform despite different motivations
- His Southern manner is a choice; he can code-switch when needed
- The Church members aboard (there are several) look to him constantly
- He might keep a journal during the voyage—material for future scripture
- Avoid making him ridiculous; his faith is strange but genuine
