## Physical Presence

Aisha is small, quick, and precise. She moves with the efficiency of someone who has worked trauma wards where seconds matter. Dark hair pulled back in a practical braid, no jewelry, minimal makeup. She wears her medical coat like armor. Her hands are her most notable feature—small, steady, capable. She has the habit of rubbing her thumb against her fingertips when she's thinking, as if preparing for a procedure.

Her face is expressive despite her attempts at neutrality. Patients can read her concern, her focus, her relief. She's given up trying to maintain a poker face; she's decided that visible humanity is part of her treatment.

She speaks fast, thinks faster. Her Canadian accent flattens her Dhaka-influenced English into something international and efficient.

## Background

### Early Life
Born in Dhaka, 2044, into a family of physicians. Her grandfather ran a clinic during the floods; her mother was a pediatrician; her father taught anatomy. Medicine was the family calling. She was suturing at fourteen—assisting in her grandfather's clinic during the emergency years.

Emigrated to Canada at seventeen for education. Never quite felt she belonged in either place; learned to be comfortable with not belonging.

### Medical Training (2062–2071)
McGill for undergraduate, Toronto for medical school, emergency medicine residency at a trauma center during the urban crisis years. Saw everything: gunshot wounds, overdoses, industrial accidents, the casualties of systems failing. Developed a reputation for calm under pressure and impatience with bureaucracy.

### Humanitarian Work (2071–2077)
Worked with Médecins Sans Frontières during the climate displacement crises. Bangladesh when the delta flooded permanently. The Pacific relocation camps. Te Rarawa during its construction—treating workers in the shadow of the rising elevator.

This is where she first understood what she was seeing: a miracle built on bodies.

### Aerospace Medicine (2077–2085)
The Consortium recruited her to develop medical protocols for long-duration climber voyages. She took the job because she was burned out on humanitarian work, because the money was good, because she wanted to understand this thing that had risen from the waters where her patients had drowned.

She's made thirty ascents, treating everything from space sickness to cardiac events to a birth (premature, successful, the child is now five and living in orbital station Beta).

## Psychology

### Core Trait: Fierce Competence
Aisha knows how good she is. She's not arrogant—she's accurate. In a medical emergency, she becomes utterly focused, emotions set aside, decisions made with speed and precision. Afterward, she might shake. During, she's ice.

### The Humanitarian's Burden
She's seen too much suffering to be naive about the world. She carries memories: the child who died because there weren't enough ventilators, the worker who fell during tether construction and couldn't be saved, the lottery winner who had a heart attack from the excitement of winning. She manages this through compartmentalization, exercise, and the occasional night of crying in her cabin.

### The Ethical Tangle
Aisha knows the elevator's shadow intimately—she treated the workers who built it. Now she serves the Consortium, keeps passengers healthy, enables the system. She's made her peace: she helps individual humans regardless of how they came to be in her medical bay. She can't fix the world; she can fix the person in front of her.

But the maiden voyage is testing this peace. She's treating lottery winners who won a miracle and Premium passengers who bought one. She's serving a system that gave some people tickets and denied others. She's aboard a vessel climbing above a city built on the bones of a drowned nation.

### Private Life
Divorced (from a fellow doctor who couldn't handle her humanitarian absences). No children. A cat back on Earth being cared for by a neighbor. She reads poetry—Tagore, Atwood, the anonymous verses written by Te Rarawa workers. She runs on the treadmill every day, even in low gravity. She doesn't drink on duty, which is most of the time.

## Key Relationships

### With Captain Osei
Deep mutual respect. They've worked together for three years and have an easy professional rapport. Aisha keeps the Captain informed of any medical situations that might affect operations; the Captain gives Aisha the resources she needs without micromanagement.

### With Her Medical Team
She runs a team of four: two nurses, a paramedic, and a physiologist. She's trained them personally, trusts them completely. She's demanding but appreciative. She buys them coffee (or the shipboard equivalent) and remembers their birthdays.

### With Passengers
Aisha treats every patient the same—Premium or Economy, executive or worker. This has caused friction with entitled VIPs who expect priority treatment. She doesn't care. The triage protocols are medical, not economic. "Your net worth doesn't affect your blood pressure."

### With Yusuf (POV Character)
If Yusuf ends up in the medical bay—for any reason—Aisha is who he'll encounter. She treated workers during construction. She might have treated people he knew. This creates an unexpected connection: they understand the same shadow, from different angles.

## The Maiden Voyage

### Medical Challenges
- 500 passengers with diverse medical histories
- Transition from Earth gravity to near-weightlessness
- Space sickness (expected in 15-20% of first-time travelers)
- Psychological stress of confinement and altitude
- The unknown effects of the voyage on vulnerable passengers
- The pressure of being the only Level-1 trauma facility between Earth and the Hub

### Her Concerns
- The elderly passengers (cardiac risks increase with stress)
- The children (how will they adapt?)
- The passengers hiding conditions that would have disqualified them
- The mental health load—five hundred people, seven days, one vessel
- What happens if there's a mass casualty event

### What She's Watching
- Passenger vital signs (monitored continuously through optional wearables)
- Social temperature (conflict increases medical incidents)
- Her own fatigue levels (she can't help anyone if she collapses)

## Voice and Manner

Aisha speaks in medical efficiency when working: short sentences, precise vocabulary, no wasted words. "Symptoms? When did they start? Any medications? Allergies? Lie back, please." She softens when the crisis is past—her voice warms, she touches shoulders, she explains what happened in terms patients can understand.

Off-duty, she's warmer but still direct. She has opinions and shares them. She doesn't suffer fools. She laughs easily at absurdity—a defense mechanism from years of humanitarian work. She asks questions that cut to the heart of things.

**Sample speech patterns:**

In emergency: "Clear the area. I need IV access, vitals on the monitor, oxygen ready. What's his name? Mr. Lindqvist? Sir, I'm Dr. Rahman. You're having a cardiac event. We're going to take care of you. Try to stay calm. Breathe."

To a nervous patient: "Space sickness is normal. Forty years of orbital medicine, and we still don't know exactly why some people adapt quickly and others don't. Here's what we're going to do..."

Off-duty: "The observation deck at 0300? It's when you can actually think up there without some executive wanting to network. The view doesn't care what you paid for your ticket."

## Arc Potential

Aisha's journey might be:

**Beginning:** The consummate professional, managing medical operations, holding herself at clinical distance from the voyage's larger meanings

**Middle:** A medical crisis forces her to work with passengers she might otherwise avoid—or to make decisions that reveal her values. The workers she once treated, now passengers, recognize her.

**End:** Perhaps she finds some reconciliation with her role in the system. Perhaps she decides to leave after this voyage. Perhaps she carries new patients' stories alongside the old ones.

---

## Thematic Function

Aisha represents **care within compromised systems**—the ethics of helping individuals while serving institutions that cause harm. Through her, the novel can explore:

- The medical reality of the voyage (bodies in transition)
- The lingering costs of construction (workers' health, long-term effects)
- The gap between treating symptoms and addressing causes
- What it means to heal in a world that wounds
- Bangladeshi diaspora and climate displacement memory

She's seen the shadow. She treats it, one patient at a time.

## Notes for Writers

- Aisha provides a natural window into the physical experience of ascent
- Her medical bay is a liminal space where class distinctions break down
- She has knowledge about workers' health that could be relevant to Yusuf's arc
- She's a potential ally for characters seeking truth or care
- Her competence is unshakeable; her moral clarity is tested
- Medical scenes should be accurate; research physiology of spaceflight
