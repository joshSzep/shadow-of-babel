## Physical Description

- Tall, angular, carries herself with quiet authority
- Gray-streaked natural hair, usually wrapped
- Reading glasses she's constantly losing
- Hands show decades of work—she still sketches by hand
- Dresses practically; her one indulgence is intricate earrings
- Moves carefully; a back injury from a construction site visit never fully healed
- Face shows every year but eyes remain sharp, curious

## Background

### Early Life
- Born in Lagos to an engineer father and teacher mother
- Childhood defined by her father's bridge projects across West Africa
- Watched him navigate the politics of infrastructure in post-colonial states
- Learned that building was never just technical—always political

### Education
- Engineering degree from University of Lagos
- PhD in structural mechanics at Imperial College London
- Postdoctoral work on carbon nanotube composites at MIT
- Returned to Nigeria, then recruited by the Consortium

### Career Arc

**The Babel Years**
- Joined the elevator project at age 34 as a structural specialist
- Rose to Chief Structural Engineer by 45
- Solved the "oscillation problem"—the mathematical insight that made the tether stable
- Her name is on the fundamental patents
- Worked 80-hour weeks for fifteen years
- Celebrated, honored, exhausted

**The Departure**
- Left the Consortium at 57, officially retired
- The real reasons: burnout, moral fatigue, grief
- Watched promises to workers be broken
- Saw safety concerns dismissed for timelines
- Lost colleagues in construction accidents
- Couldn't fight anymore; couldn't stay

**The Years Since**
- Lives quietly in Cornwall, UK
- Consults occasionally, mostly declines
- Writes a memoir, repeatedly abandons it
- Attends memorial services for dead colleagues
- Asked to return for the maiden voyage
- Said no three times. Then said yes.

## Psychology

### Core Traits
- Brilliant but not arrogant about it
- Driven by the elegance of solutions
- Deeply ethical, which is why she suffers
- Conflict-averse but principled when pushed
- More comfortable with equations than emotions
- Carries guilt she rarely articulates

### Internal Conflicts
- **Pride vs. Shame:** She built a wonder. She built an injustice.
- **Recognition vs. Responsibility:** Celebrated for the triumph, silent about the cost
- **Isolation vs. Connection:** Left to escape, but left people behind
- **Past vs. Present:** The young idealist versus the tired realist

### Fears
- That she's complicit in something unforgivable
- That her life's work served the wrong people
- That she can't face Yusuf and people like him
- That there's no redemption, only reckoning

### Hopes
- To find peace with what she built
- To honor those who died or were exploited
- To see the view from the top, once, finally
- To understand if it was worth it

## Relationships

### Professional
- Respected by engineers worldwide, "The Mother of Babel"
- Complicated history with Consortium leadership
- Viewed with suspicion by some workers ("She got rich; we got promises")
- Mentored many young engineers; some resent her departure

### Personal
- Never married; "married to the project," she sometimes jokes bitterly
- Close to her younger sister, a doctor in Abuja
- Had a long relationship with a Consortium executive; ended badly
- Few friends; the work consumed everything
- Reconnecting with former colleagues for the voyage

### On the Climber
- Recognized by many passengers
- Sought out by journalists (Amara has history with her)
- Avoids Henrik's corporate circles
- Will eventually encounter Yusuf—the confrontation she dreads
- Sees Zara as the young engineer she once was

## The Maiden Voyage Arc

### Act I: Boarding
- Arrives at the anchor city, overwhelmed by what it's become
- The tether she designed dominates the skyline
- Memories flood back: the early days, the losses
- Boards in the VIP section, uncomfortable with the privilege
- The first view of the climber interior—her designs, realized

### Act II: Early Ascent
- The beauty hits her; she weeps alone
- Journalists approach; she gives careful, rehearsed answers
- Glimpses workers, lottery winners, the diversity she wanted
- Attends official dinners, feels like a ghost at her own monument
- Begins writing notes—the memoir finally taking shape?

### Act III: Mid-Ascent
- Encounters Yusuf (or learns he's aboard)
- The confrontation she's avoided for years approaches
- Reflects on specific failures: safety meetings ignored, promises unkept
- A systems anomaly—minor—triggers memories of near-disasters
- Her expertise is called upon; she solves a problem, feels useful

### Act IV: High Altitude
- The conversation with Yusuf finally happens
- It's not what she expected—more complicated, more human
- She can't give him what he wants; he can't give her absolution
- They reach an understanding, or they don't
- The overview effect: Earth below, her life's work visible as a thread

### Act V: Arrival
- Reaches the orbital hub she helped design
- The future she enabled is breathtaking and troubling
- Decides what to do with her remaining years
- The memoir will be written—but what will it say?
- Final image: looking back at Earth, looking forward at what comes next

## Voice and Style

### Interior Monologue
- Precise, technical, but emotionally layered
- Uses engineering metaphors for human problems
- Self-critical, sometimes to excess
- Finds beauty in systems, structures, solutions
- Memories surface as intrusions—flashbacks to construction years

### Dialogue
- Measured, professional in public
- More open with peers and younger engineers
- Defensive when confronted about the past
- Capable of sharp observations
- Rarely raises her voice; when she does, it matters

### Sample Internal Passage

*The tether rises from the terminal like she drew it thirty years ago on a napkin in a Lagos hotel bar. Same curve, same impossible grace. But the napkin didn't include the security checkpoints, the class-segregated boarding, the faces of the workers who built it watching from behind barriers. She put the mathematics on paper. Someone else decided what the mathematics would mean.*

## Key Scenes to Write

1. **Arrival at the anchor city**: First sight of the tether she designed
2. **Boarding the climber**: Walking through her blueprints made real
3. **The interview with Amara**: Dancing around the hard questions
4. **The encounter with Yusuf**: Years of guilt meeting years of anger
5. **The technical crisis**: Her expertise saves something; she feels purpose
6. **The overview moment**: Earth from above, her life in perspective
7. **The decision**: What she'll do with the rest of her life

## Thematic Role

Miriam represents the **creator's dilemma**: She made something miraculous. She cannot control what it became. Her journey asks:

- Is creation ever innocent?
- What do we owe those harmed by our work?
- Can genius excuse complicity?
- Is there redemption for the architect of an unjust wonder?

She is Babel's mother. The question is whether she can live with her child.
