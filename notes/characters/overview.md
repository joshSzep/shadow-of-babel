# Character Overview

## POV Philosophy

The novel uses multiple POV characters to refract the themes of **awe** and **shadow** through different relationships with the elevator and what it represents. Each character embodies a different answer to the central questions:

- Who owns the future when the future is above the sky?
- Does ambition justify inequality?
- What do people see when they rise above their world?

## Ensemble Dynamics

### Connections Between POVs

- Miriam and Teiti share culpability: the architect and the displaced
- Teiti and Yusuf share solidarity: both builders, both betrayed, different losses
- Zara is traveling on a scholarship funded by Henrik's company
- Teiti sees in Zara a young person being used—potential mentorship
- Amara has interviewed Miriam before; has files on Henrik
- Amara sees in Teiti the story that matters—if she can tell it honestly
- All six will be in the same space at key moments
- Their paths cross naturally through the climber's structure

### Thematic Counterpoints
- Miriam and Henrik: Creators with different relationships to creation

- Yusuf and Zara: Different generations, different access points
- Yusuf and Teiti: Shared rage, different losses—labor vs. homeland
- Amara: The observer who becomes participant
- Teiti: The witness who refuses to bless
- Each sees the others through their own lens

## Writing Notes

- Each POV should have a distinct voice and rhythm
- Chapters alternate between POVs, not strictly rotating
- Some moments seen from multiple perspectives (key scenes)
- Interior monologue varies by character: Miriam is analytical, Yusuf is visceral, Zara is questioning, Henrik is justifying, Amara is observational, Teiti is patient and tidal
- All six are sympathetic; none are villains; all are compromised
