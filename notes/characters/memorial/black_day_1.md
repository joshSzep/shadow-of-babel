# Black Day — September 14, 2062

## The Eight Hundred and Forty-Seven

On September 14, 2062, a catastrophic ribbon break during the Thickening phase killed 847 workers—the single deadliest day in the elevator's construction. The break occurred at approximately 8,000 km altitude during a repair operation. The lower section whipped downward; recovery crews were caught in the debris field.

The Consortium declared three days of mourning. Construction resumed on day four.

**Time:** 14:23 UTC
**Cause:** Material fatigue in a ribbon junction, exacerbated by schedule pressure
