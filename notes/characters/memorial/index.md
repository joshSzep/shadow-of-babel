## The Ceremony Structure

In Chapter 36, Teiti speaks the names in a specific order:

1. **Her husband first:** Teriki Nakibae (Anchor Collapse)
2. **Her son second:** Tebuke Nakibae (radiation-linked cancer)
3. **The Anchor Collapse twenty-three:** Those who died with Teriki
4. **Black Day:** The 847, read by nationality groups
5. **The Twelve:** The Climber 17 crew
6. **The Construction Dead:** Other incidents across the decades
7. **The Radiation Dead:** Those who died slowly, denied acknowledgment
8. **The Disappeared:** Those erased, whose deaths were never recorded

Then she speaks for what cannot be named:
- The reef
- The fish that no longer exist
- The species that went extinct before cataloguing
- The waters where her grandfather fished

## Reading Notes for Writers

When Teiti reads the names:
- She speaks each name fully—no rushing, no abbreviation
- The ceremony takes hours; some names she knew personally
- The I-Kiribati names she speaks in Gilbertese pronunciation
- Other names she speaks as closely to correct as she can
- For the radiation dead, she often adds how they died: "the cancer, the cancer, the cancer"
- For the disappeared, she says only: "name unknown; the Consortium knows"

The reading is not performance. It is *witness*.
