## The Aftermath

- The Consortium declared three days of mourning; construction resumed on day four
- Families demanded answers; internal investigations were classified
- Settlements were offered contingent on non-disclosure agreements
- Those who refused to sign were quietly blacklisted

The **Memorial Wall** at Te Rarawa lists these 847 names—the only official monument. The Consortium has never added a single name since its creation in 2063.
