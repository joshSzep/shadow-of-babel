# The Radiation Dead (2070–2085)

## The One Hundred and Eighty-Seven

These are the workers who died slowly. The Consortium classified their deaths as "natural causes"—cancer, organ failure, immune collapse. But the workers knew. The Union knew. Teiti knows.

A 2070 leak revealed what workers had long suspected: crews working above 20,000 km had 340% higher rates of certain cancers. The Consortium had known for at least five years. Workers had not been informed of risks or offered monitoring.

For these dead, Teiti speaks their names and adds: "the cancer, the cancer, the cancer."

## The Disclosure

In February 2070, internal Consortium medical data was leaked. It showed:

- Elevated cancer rates among high-altitude repair crews
- Correlation between time at altitude and disease incidence  
- Evidence that the Consortium had known for years
- No disclosure to affected workers

The Consortium initially denied, then acknowledged the data. Quiet settlements followed—contingent on silence. Enhanced shielding was implemented for new climbers. Workers already exposed received no additional protection.

Over the following decades, hundreds developed cancers linked to their service. Many died before the elevator opened. Their names are not on the Memorial Wall—their deaths were classified as "natural causes."

## The Silence

The Consortium has never acknowledged these deaths as work-related. Each death certificate lists "natural causes." No settlement has ever admitted liability. The families who signed received money contingent on silence—and a prohibition on mentioning the Consortium in any legal proceeding.

The workers who lived long enough to see the disclosure leak in 2070 at least knew why they were dying. Those who died before—like Youssef Mahmoud, who died in 2067—never knew.

Teiti speaks their names with the same weight as Black Day. A slower death is still a death. The Consortium killed them; the Consortium refuses to say so.

For these, she adds: "the cancer, the cancer, the cancer."
