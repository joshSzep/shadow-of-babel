# The Disappeared

## The Twenty-Two

These are the workers who vanished. No bodies recovered. No death certificates issued. No settlements paid. The Consortium says they deserted, or their records were lost, or they never existed at all.

The workers know better. The Union knows. Teiti knows.

For these, she speaks only: "Name unknown to us; the Consortium knows."

## What Disappearance Means

In the forty years of Babel's construction, 22 workers disappeared under circumstances the Consortium refuses to explain:

- Bodies never recovered after accidents (listed as "presumed living, whereabouts unknown")
- Workers who vanished during labor disputes (records erased)
- Witnesses to unsafe conditions who stopped reporting for shifts
- Organizers who one day simply weren't there

The Consortium maintains no one "disappeared"—they departed, deserted, or were terminated and deported. But their families received no bodies. Their final wages were never paid. Their names were removed from employment records.

The Shadow Memorial lists them as "The Unnamed"—with space left blank for names no one will speak.

## What Teiti Says

For each of these, Teiti cannot speak their names—because no one will speak their names. The Consortium erased them.

Instead, she says:

> "A worker who told the truth. The Consortium knows their name."
> 
> "A worker who organized. The Consortium knows their name."
> 
> "A worker who witnessed. The Consortium knows their name."

She speaks this 22 times. Once for each of the disappeared.

And then:

> "They are not lost. They are hidden. Speak their names."

This is an accusation. This is an invitation. Someone, somewhere, knows what happened to these 22 workers. Teiti is asking them to remember.

## The Pattern

The disappearances share common elements:

1. **Witness or organizer status**: All 22 had documented, reported, or organized around unsafe conditions or broken promises
2. **Timing**: Most disappeared shortly after taking action
3. **Records manipulation**: Employment records were altered, destroyed, or never created
4. **Family silence**: Families either received no information or were pressured not to inquire
5. **No investigation**: The Consortium never investigated any disappearance

The disappeared are not accidents. They are policy.

## The Unnamed Memorial

On the Shadow Memorial in the Workers' Quarter, below the named dead, there is a section marked:

**THE UNNAMED**

Twenty-two blank stones. Space left for names that may never be spoken.

Workers who pass touch the stones. They say: "We remember that you existed."

The Consortium has twice attempted to remove this section. Both times, workers rebuilt it within hours.

---

## A Note on "The Ghost"

Labor history mentions "The Ghost"—a legendary figure in labor organizing who disappeared in 2073 and is rumored to still operate in Te Rarawa's outer rings. The Ghost may be:

- One of the disappeared who survived
- A collective identity used by multiple organizers
- A myth that serves organizing purposes
- All of these

If the Ghost is real, they know who the disappeared were. They may be the only one who does.
