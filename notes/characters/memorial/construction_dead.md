# Other Construction Deaths (2047–2085)

## The One Hundred and Fifty-Six

Beyond Black Day, the Anchor Collapse, and the Twelve, hundreds died in smaller incidents across nearly four decades of construction. Some died in groups; most died alone. The Consortium never aggregated these deaths into a single memorial. Teiti speaks their names.
