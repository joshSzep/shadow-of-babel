# The Anchor Collapse — October 17, 2065

## The Twenty-Three

On the night of October 17, 2065, a subsea anchor reinforcement structure failed at the base of the tether. The collapse occurred 40 meters below the surface during a night shift. Twenty-three workers died, trapped in flooding compartments or crushed by collapsing infrastructure.

**Cause:** Faulty welds, rushed timelines, ignored safety warnings.

**Location:** Subsea anchor platform, Sector 7, Te Rarawa foundation.
