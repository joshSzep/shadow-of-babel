# Passenger Manifest Framework

## Overview

The maiden voyage carries **500 passengers** aboard the climber. This document provides a framework for developing a rich, diverse cast that makes the ascent feel populated with real people—each with their own relationship to the elevator and what it represents.

The goal is not to detail all 500, but to create enough texture that any scene can draw on named characters with histories, and that the social stratification of the climber feels lived-in.

## Character Development Tiers

Not all 500 passengers need equal development. Use this hierarchy:

### Fully Developed (5-10 pages each): 5 characters
The POV characters. Complete backstory, psychology, arc, voice.
- Miriam, Yusuf, Zara, Henrik, Amara

### Richly Developed (1-2 pages each): 10-15 characters
Named characters with scenes, dialogue, and their own small arcs.
- President Teannaki, Captain Osei, Director Nakamura
- Key lottery winners, Zara's scholarship cohort, Henrik's business rivals
- Characters who recur across multiple POV chapters

### Sketched (1-2 paragraphs each): 30-50 characters
Named characters with a defining trait, backstory hook, and function.
- The Reyes family members, Reverend Whitmore, specific journalists
- Crew members who interact with POV characters
- Passengers who represent types but have individual texture

### Named Background (1-2 sentences each): 50-100 characters
Names and single identifying details for crowd scenes.
- "Dr. Yuki Tanaka, the geologist from Osaka who won the lottery on her third try"
- "The Okonkwo cousins from Lagos, teenagers traveling without parents"
- Enough to make any scene feel populated with individuals

### Unnamed Types: The remaining ~300
Generic references that establish the crowd without specificity.
- "A cluster of lottery winners from Southeast Asia"
- "Several executives in matching corporate blazers"
- The sense of a full vessel without the burden of naming everyone

---

## Diversity Considerations

The passenger manifest should reflect:

### Geographic Distribution
The elevator's base is in the Pacific, but access is global. Consider:
- Host nation presence (Kiribati, Pacific Islands)
- Major spacefaring nations (China, US, EU, India, Japan)
- Global South representation (Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia)
- Diaspora and mixed heritage (reflecting 2085 mobility)

### Age Range
- Children and families (the future inheriting this future)
- Young adults (Zara's generation, digital natives of the orbital age)
- Middle-aged (the builders, the professionals, the established)
- Elderly (those who remember before, who never expected this)

### Ability and Accessibility
- The climber accommodates various physical needs
- Some passengers are ascending for medical reasons (orbital treatment)
- Neurodiversity represented without tokenism

### Economic Background
- Even within tiers, gradations of wealth and precarity
- Lottery winners from poverty alongside middle-class winners
- Corporate passengers range from billionaires to junior employees

### Languages and Cultures
- Multiple languages spoken aboard
- Religious diversity (including Babel Church members)
- Cultural tensions and connections across the voyage

## Character Hooks by Category

Quick prompts for developing individual passengers:

### Lottery Winners
- Why did they enter? (Hope, desperation, whim, protest)
- Who are they leaving behind? (Family, obligations, a life)

- How do they feel about their luck? (Grateful, guilty, suspicious)

### Corporate Passengers
- What deal are they making? (Orbital contracts, political access)
- What do they stand to gain or lose? (Fortune, reputation, power)
- How do they see the other passengers? (Colleagues, obstacles, invisible)
- What don't they want exposed? (Everyone has secrets at this level)

### Workers and Builders
- What did they sacrifice to build this? (Years, health, relationships)
- What were they promised? (Passage, payment, recognition)
- Why are they here now? (Vindication, closure, curiosity, anger)
- What do they think when they see the Premium Deck? (Rage, resignation, strategy)

### Students and Scholars
- What do they hope to become? (Scientists, engineers, leaders)
- Who selected them, and why? (Merit, optics, potential)
- What pressure are they under? (To succeed, to represent, to be grateful)
- What are they beginning to notice? (The system behind the selection)

### Political Figures
- What does their nation need from orbit? (Resources, prestige, survival)
- What compromises have they made? (Everyone has, at this level)
- Who are they performing for? (Constituents, peers, themselves)
- What would change if the voyage went wrong? (Everything, nothing)

## Relationship Mapping

Characters become vivid through connections:

### Pre-existing Relationships
- Family members traveling together
- Colleagues who know each other's secrets
- Old rivals meeting in a confined space
- Former lovers, estranged friends, bitter enemies

### Relationships Formed During Voyage
- Strangers who bond over shared observation moments
- Cross-class friendships that challenge assumptions
- Conflicts that escalate in the confined space
- Mentorships, romances, alliances of convenience

### Connections to POV Characters
- Every significant secondary character should connect to at least one POV
- Some characters bridge multiple POVs (visible from different angles)
- The ensemble should create a web, not isolated clusters

---

## Functional Roles in Narrative

Characters serve story purposes:

### Mirrors
Characters who reflect a POV character's qualities or situation
- Another architect for Miriam to measure herself against
- A lottery winner who took a different path than Yusuf
- A scholarship student who embraced the system Zara questions

### Foils
Characters who contrast with POV characters
- A builder who feels no anger, only pride
- An industrialist who sees the shadow clearly and doesn't care
- A journalist who sold out completely for access

### Catalysts
Characters who force POV characters to act or change
- Someone who confronts Miriam with consequences she avoided
- A passenger who asks Henrik a question he can't answer
- The person who tells Amara the story she can't ignore

### Witnesses
Characters who observe and validate the POV character's experience
- Crew members who see everything
- Quiet passengers who notice more than they say
- Children who ask the questions adults avoid

## Development Process

### Phase 1: Skeleton
Create the manifest categories and rough numbers. Establish the social geography of the climber.

### Phase 2: Key Secondary Characters
Develop 10-15 richly drawn characters who recur throughout the novel. Give them individual files if needed.

### Phase 3: Scene-Specific Characters
As chapters are drafted, create sketched characters for specific scenes. Add to the manifest as they're invented.

### Phase 4: Background Texture
Build a list of named background characters to draw from for crowd scenes and passing references.

### Phase 5: Consistency Pass
Review the manifest for balance, diversity, and thematic coverage. Ensure connections are mapped.
