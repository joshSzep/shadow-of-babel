## Family Members

### Elena Reyes — The Matriarch
**Age:** 58  
**Role:** Grandmother, family center

Elena is the one who started the application. Thirty years as a hospital housekeeper—she's held the hands of the dying, cleaned up after the living, kept a ward running while nurses rotated in and out. Her supervisor wrote the first reference letter. Her pastor wrote the second. The hospital's community outreach coordinator—who'd noticed that Elena had quietly trained six younger housekeepers over the years, all immigrants like herself—helped her frame it: "Thirty years of service. Community leadership through example. Cultural bridge-building in healthcare settings."

She didn't think she'd survive the first review round. When she passed to regionals, she cried. When they called her in for the interview, she wore her best dress—the one from her daughter's wedding. When they asked why she wanted to ascend, she said: "I've spent my life caring for people at the end. I want to see what's at the beginning."

The random selection happened on live broadcast. Elena wasn't watching; she was at work. Carmen called her screaming.

**Physical presence:** Small, soft, with the quiet authority of someone who's held a family together through everything. Silver hair, deep brown skin, hands that have cleaned and cooked and comforted. She wears her best dress on the climber—the same one from the interview. It still fits.

**Psychology:** Elena processes the world through faith and family. She's Catholic, deeply; the voyage is a pilgrimage, even if she's not sure to what. She's overwhelmed by the luxury, the attention, the deference—she keeps trying to clean up after herself, uncomfortable being served. She's also watching everything with sharp eyes, aware that her family is being used as a symbol.

The application process changed her. She had to articulate her worth, prove her contribution, submit to interviews and evaluations. She passed, but the experience left her with a quiet anger she doesn't often express: *Why should I have to justify my right to see the sky?*

### Marco Reyes — The Skeptic
**Age:** 34  
**Role:** Elena's son, single father

Marco didn't apply for himself. He was listed as Elena's guest allocation—lottery winners receive passage for up to three immediate family members, subject to abbreviated security vetting. He passed the background check, the health screening, the psychological evaluation. He signed the publicity waivers, the liability releases, the conduct agreements.

He works construction—spent two years on a Te Rarawa subcontractor crew, though he never touched the elevator itself. He knows how the sausage is made: the twelve-hour shifts, the safety shortcuts, the workers who didn't go home. He saw colleagues apply for the lottery and get rejected at the merit review stage. *What meaningful contribution?* They built the thing. That wasn't enough.

He's uncomfortable being the Consortium's feel-good story. He knows he's here because his mother jumped through their hoops, proved herself worthy by their standards. He also knows his mother deserves this, his daughter deserves this, and refusing would only hurt them.

**Physical presence:** Broad-shouldered, calloused hands, a face that doesn't hide what he's thinking. He wears his good jeans and a clean shirt, refusing to dress up for the VIPs.

**Psychology:** Marco carries anger he doesn't fully express. He's seen the inequality up close—both in Te Rarawa and in the lottery's "tournament of worthiness." But he's also watching his mother's face as she looks at the stars, watching his daughter press her hands against the observation windows—and the anger gives way to something more complicated.

### Sofia Reyes — The Daughter
**Age:** 8  
**Role:** Marco's daughter, Elena's granddaughter

Sofia is the reason the family said yes. When the Consortium offered the tickets, Marco was ready to refuse—until Sofia saw the pictures of the elevator and asked, "Can we really go to space?"

She was too young for the full vetting process; children under twelve are covered by parental consent. But she still had the health screening, still had her picture taken for the publicity files. She doesn't understand why they had to sign so many papers. She just knows she's going to space.

She's bright, curious, unimpressed by wealth but fascinated by everything technical. She asks the crew questions they don't expect. She's already decided she wants to be an astronaut—or an engineer—or maybe the person who drives the climber.

**Physical presence:** Small for her age, dark braids, perpetually in motion. She wears a homemade patch on her jacket that says "SPACE GIRL" in glitter letters.

**Psychology:** Sofia experiences the voyage as pure wonder. She doesn't understand the politics, the class dynamics, the tensions. She sees the stars, and they're beautiful. Her innocence is both genuine and a mirror for the adults around her—reminding them what awe looks like without shadow.

### Tita Carmen — The Documenter
**Age:** 62  
**Role:** Elena's sister, along for the journey

Carmen is Elena's younger sister, a retired nurse who never married, who's always been the family's archivist and storyteller. She went through the same abbreviated security vetting as Marco—background check, health screening, the gauntlet of waivers and releases.

She almost failed the psychological evaluation. When the assessor asked if she had any concerns about the voyage, Carmen said: "Yes. I'm concerned that my sister had to prove she deserved this. She's cleaned hospitals for thirty years. That should be enough." The assessor made a note. Carmen passed anyway—barely.

Now she's filming everything—not for social media (the publicity agreements restrict what she can post) but for family memory. Every meal, every view, every moment her sister's eyes go wide.

**Physical presence:** Rounder than Elena, louder, with reading glasses on a chain and a phone always raised. She wears bright colors that clash gloriously.

**Psychology:** Carmen is the one who says what others think. She's not awed into silence; she narrates, exclaims, compares everything to something from home. "This is nice, but have you tried your lola's adobo?" She's the family's armor—her noise protects them from the intensity of being seen.

She's also the one who read the fine print. She knows what they signed. She knows what they can't say. It makes her angrier than Elena's quiet resentment, but she channels it into documentation—capturing everything, even the things she can't share publicly. Not yet.

## The Family Dynamic

The Reyes family functions as a unit:
- Elena is the moral center—what she feels, the family honors
- Marco is the protector—watching for threats, managing logistics
- Sofia is the joy—her wonder justifies everything
- Carmen is the voice—saying the things that need saying

They're close in ways that make the other passengers—especially the wealthy ones—uncomfortable. They eat together, pray together, laugh loudly. They're not performing for the cameras; they're just being themselves, which reads as performance to people who've forgotten how families work.

The lottery process has marked them. They know they were selected, vetted, approved—not just lucky, but *deemed worthy*. The distinction matters. Elena feels grateful and resentful in equal measure. Marco sees it as another system that justifies inequality by pretending to be fair. Carmen is cataloging every absurdity. Sofia just wants to see the stars.

## The Application Story

Elena's journey through the lottery:

**Phase 1: Application**
Her pastor suggested it after a sermon about reaching for heaven. "You've served this community for decades. Write that down. Let them see you."

She spent three weeks on the written justification. Carmen helped with the English; Marco helped scan the documents. Letters of reference from her supervisor, her pastor, the community outreach coordinator. Proof of her training program for immigrant housekeepers. Documentation of her church volunteer work.

**Phase 2: Regional Review**
Los Angeles processed 847,000 applications. Elena made the first cut—the top 15,000. The letter said her application demonstrated "meaningful community impact through sustained service."

**Phase 3: Background Screening**
Invasive. Financial records (she's never had debt; she's also never had savings). Health assessments (good, considering her age and her work). Criminal history (clean). Social connections (mapped and evaluated). The questionnaires asked about her political views, her religious beliefs, her attitudes toward the Consortium. She answered honestly. She doesn't know if that helped or hurt.

**Phase 4: Interview**
Thirty minutes in a Consortium office in downtown Los Angeles. Three interviewers, none of them smiling. They asked about her work, her family, her hopes for the voyage. They asked what she would tell people back on Earth. She said: "That it's beautiful. And that everyone deserves to see it."

**Phase 5: Random Selection**
Among 2,400 Los Angeles finalists, 12 lottery slots were drawn. Elena's name was seventh. The broadcast happened while she was at work, scrubbing a hospital floor. She didn't know she'd won until Carmen's screaming call.

## Thematic Function

The Reyes family represents **the lottery promise**—the idea that the elevator can be for everyone, that access can be democratized. They're also the test of that promise:

- Are they genuinely included, or tokenized for PR?
- Does winning change anything structural, or just relocate four people?
- Can wonder survive awareness of exploitation?
- What does it mean that they had to *prove their worth* to access the sky?
- What do they see that the wealthy passengers—who simply purchased tickets—cannot?

They're the emotional heart of the Standard Deck—the passengers the system claims to serve.

## Key Relationships

### With the Consortium
Director Nakamura has assigned a media liaison specifically to them. They're photographed at every official event. Their reactions are sought, quoted, broadcast—within the bounds of the publicity agreements they signed. Elena is gracious; Marco is minimal; Sofia is oblivious; Carmen asks questions that make the liaison uncomfortable.

The family is valuable to the Consortium precisely *because* of the lottery process. Elena isn't just lucky—she's *vetted*, *approved*, deemed worthy by the system. Her story proves the lottery works: a hospital housekeeper, an immigrant, a grandmother, rose through merit review and random selection. That she had to prove herself to deserve what billionaires simply purchase—this is a feature, not a bug. It makes her passage *mean* something. It makes her gratitude *appropriate*.

The family understands this. They're playing along. They're also keeping their own record.

### With Chief Steward Volkov
Volkov takes a genuine interest in the family—perhaps because they're authentic in ways VIPs aren't, perhaps because he recognizes working people. He makes sure they have what they need without condescension. Marco notices and is grudgingly grateful.

Volkov also knows what the lottery process entails. He's seen other lottery winners—the exhaustion behind their smiles, the complicated feelings they can't express publicly. He's gentle with them in ways that go beyond professional duty.

### With Yusuf (POV Character)
Marco and Yusuf might recognize each other—not personally, but categorically. Two men who built things with their hands, now ascending the structure of their labor. But their paths diverged: Marco's mother won the lottery; Yusuf's promised passage was denied. If they meet, there's solidarity and tension: Why her and not him? Why did she have to prove herself when he'd already proven everything by building the thing?

Yusuf might be angry at them—not personally, but at what they represent: the lottery as substitute for the passages workers were promised. Marco might understand that anger better than Yusuf expects.

### With Henrik (POV Character)
Henrik might encounter Sofia during an observation deck moment—a child's wonder next to an industrialist's calculation. Sofia doesn't know who he is; she just wants to know if he's seen the moon up close. 

The encounter could crack something in Henrik—not just Sofia's innocence, but the realization of what her family went through to be here. Months of applications, evaluations, proving their worth. Henrik bought his ticket. His father's company funded the scholarships that justify the system. The gap between them is not just economic; it's ontological. She had to *become worthy*. He simply *was*.

### With Zara (POV Character)
Zara might see herself in the Reyes family—working-class people given access, used as proof the system works. The scholarship process she went through echoes Elena's lottery journey: applications, evaluations, proving merit by external standards. 

She might seek them out, curious about their experience, perhaps finding unexpected kinship with Marco's skepticism. Or she might find their situation more honest than her own—at least they know they're being used. Zara is still figuring it out.

## The Maiden Voyage

### Why They're Here
Elena won. That's the simple answer—but "winning" required months of proving herself worthy, surviving five phases of review, and finally having her name drawn from a pool of vetted finalists. The complex answer: they're here because Elena could demonstrate "meaningful contribution to human advancement" according to Consortium standards, because she passed background screening and security vetting, because she said the right things in interviews, and then—only then—because luck favored her.

They're also here because the Consortium needs them to be here. 500 passengers who simply paid would look like what it is. The lottery provides moral cover—but only because the lottery selects for stories like Elena's. A hospital housekeeper who "earned" her passage. That narrative serves everyone except the workers who built the elevator and were never given a chance to earn anything.

### Their Experience
- The luxury is disorienting—suites bigger than their apartment
- Other passengers oscillate between curiosity and condescension
- The view is genuinely transcendent—Elena cries, Sofia cheers, Marco is silent
- They're constantly aware of cameras, of their obligations under the publicity agreements
- They form quiet alliances with other lottery winners—all of whom went through the same gauntlet, all of whom understand what it cost

### What They Carry
- Elena: faith that this means something, uncertainty about what, quiet anger at having to prove her worth
- Marco: anger at the system, love for his family, grudging wonder, the knowledge that his colleagues who actually built this thing were denied the chance to apply
- Sofia: pure experience, the voyage as gift without shadow
- Carmen: determination to capture everything, preserve the memory, document what the official story won't say

### The Restrictions
The family signed extensive agreements:
- They can be photographed and interviewed at Consortium events
- Their words and images can be used for promotional purposes indefinitely
- They cannot publicly disparage the Consortium, the lottery system, or the voyage
- They cannot share certain experiences on personal social media without approval
- Violations can result in legal action and blacklisting

Carmen is very aware of these restrictions. She's also very aware that documentation can take many forms, and that agreements can be challenged, and that the truth has a way of surfacing eventually.

## Sample Moments

**Elena at the observation deck:**
She's alone—3 AM, when the deck is quiet. She looks at Earth, at the Philippines somewhere below, at the home she left forty years ago. She prays, in Tagalog, a prayer she hasn't said since childhood. "Ama namin, sumasalangit Ka..."

She thinks about the interview question: *What meaningful contribution have you made?* She thinks about the thirty years of hospital floors. She thinks about all the people who worked beside her—who couldn't document their contributions, who didn't have pastors to write letters, who couldn't navigate the application in English. She made it. They didn't. Is that fair? Is that the point?

**Marco encountering a VIP:**
A corporate executive asks how he's "enjoying the experience." Marco looks at him for a long moment. "My mother spent six months proving she deserved to be here. Background checks, interviews, evaluations. How long did your application take?"

The executive looks confused. "I... bought a ticket."

Marco nods. "Yeah." He walks away before the executive can respond.

**Sofia and the stars:**
"Lolo," she says to no one—her grandfather, dead before she was born—"I can see everything from here. I can see the whole world. I wish you could see it too."

She doesn't know about the applications, the vetting, the waivers. She doesn't know her grandmother cried filling out forms, or that her father almost didn't come. She just knows she's in space, and it's beautiful, and she wants to share it with everyone she loves—especially the ones who can't be here.

**Carmen to a journalist (off the record):**
"You want to know how it feels? It feels like winning and losing at the same time. It feels like a gift you didn't ask for from someone who made you beg for it first. My sister cleaned hospitals for thirty years. They made her *prove* that was enough. They made her sit in interviews and justify her right to see the stars. She passed. She's here. But you know what? She was always enough. She shouldn't have had to prove a damn thing."

The journalist hesitates. "I can't print that. The agreements—"

"I know," Carmen says. "But I said it. And you heard it. That's enough for now."

## Arc Potential

The Reyes family's journey:

**Beginning:** Overwhelmed, grateful, navigating a world designed for others—but carrying the complex feelings the lottery process produced. Elena's pride and resentment. Marco's anger on behalf of workers who never got to apply. Carmen's careful documentation.

**Middle:** Growing more aware of how they're being used; forming connections with other passengers; processing the experience in their different ways. Marco encounters workers, scholars, VIPs—each interaction clarifying the system's logic. Elena finds moments of genuine transcendence alongside moments of painful awareness. Carmen keeps filming.

**End:** They'll leave the voyage changed—but not in the ways the Consortium's narrative wants. Perhaps with clearer eyes, sharper questions, a story they'll tell differently than the official version. Perhaps with material Carmen has been carefully preserving. Perhaps with a sense that the lottery—for all its elaborate fairness theater—was never about access. It was about *selection*. And they were selected to make the selection look legitimate.

## Notes for Writers

- The Reyes family should appear in crowd scenes and key observation moments
- Sofia provides innocence that mirrors adult complexity
- Marco can articulate working-class perspective and critique of the lottery without becoming a mouthpiece
- Elena's faith adds spiritual dimension distinct from Whitmore's theology; her experience of the application process adds institutional critique
- Carmen's documentation creates a counter-narrative to official media—constrained by agreements but building toward something
- Their Tagalog phrases (untranslated) add authenticity
- They should be individuals, not a symbol—internally varied, sometimes disagreeing
- Avoid condescension in how they're written; they're protagonists of their own story
- The lottery process should be referenced—it marks their experience differently than purchased passage or scholarship selection
- The contrast between their journey to access and Henrik's purchased ticket is thematically rich
