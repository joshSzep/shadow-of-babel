## Physical Presence

Mei is polished—almost too polished. Every hair in place, makeup precise, uniform immaculate. She projects competence and approachability simultaneously, a skill she's spent years developing. Medium height, athletic build, features that read as "professional" in every cultural context the Consortium operates in.

She has two voices: her broadcast voice (warm, measured, authoritative) and her actual voice (faster, sharper, more profane). Most passengers only hear the first. Her crew has learned to read which Mei they're getting by the set of her shoulders.

Her tablet is always in hand. She's always monitoring something—feeds, schedules, messages, the pulse of public attention.

## Background

### Early Life
Born in San Francisco, 2052. Father was a Taiwanese naval officer who immigrated after the Strait Crisis; mother was a broadcast journalist for local news. Mei grew up bilingual, bicultural, and fluent in the language of information control.

### Military Service (2070–2076)
Joined the U.S. Space Force (the branch that handles orbital assets) straight out of college. Communications specialist—managing information flow, coordinating with media, crafting narratives. Rose to Lieutenant, served on three orbital stations. Learned how to manage crises before they became headlines.

### Transition to Consortium (2076–2085)
The Consortium recruited her to build their communications infrastructure for passenger operations. She's the one who developed the protocols for how the maiden voyage would be narrated to Earth: which cameras, which feeds, which moments would be shown and which wouldn't.

She is very good at her job. She is also, increasingly, uneasy about it.

## Psychology

### Core Trait: Narrative Control
Mei thinks in stories. Every event is material; every moment can be framed. She understands that reality is what people believe, and what people believe is shaped by what they're shown. This isn't cynicism—she sees it as responsibility. Someone has to tell the story. Better someone competent than someone careless.

### The PR Mask
She's been the Consortium's voice for so long that she sometimes forgets where the institutional position ends and her own beliefs begin. She defends the elevator's virtues reflexively, deflects criticism smoothly. It's only in quiet moments that she wonders if she's a communicator or a propagandist.

### The Journalist's Daughter
Her mother taught her that stories should serve truth, not power. Mei has strayed from that teaching, and she knows it. The maiden voyage is the biggest story of her career—and she's controlling the narrative instead of uncovering it. Every time she looks at Amara Diallo, the actual journalist, she feels a pang of something she doesn't want to name.

### Ambition and Doubt
She wants the maiden voyage to be perfect. A perfect story, a perfect launch for the passenger era, a career-defining success. But she's also started collecting a folder of things she's not broadcasting—the worker stories, the access inequities, the protests in Te Rarawa. She tells herself it's for context. She's not sure if she's archiving or suppressing.

## Key Relationships

### With Captain Osei
Formal and somewhat tense. The Captain sees Mei as a PR complication; Mei sees the Captain as insufficiently appreciative of optics. They work together professionally but don't trust each other's priorities.

### With Director Nakamura
Nakamura is her ally on the command team—they both care about the narrative. But he's political where she's technical, and she's increasingly aware that he'd sacrifice her to protect the Consortium's interests.

### With Chief Steward Volkov
An unexpected affinity. They both manage performances; they both understand the gap between image and reality. They share a dark humor about their roles. He's the only one aboard she's truly candid with.

### With Amara Diallo (POV Character)
Complicated and charged. Mei is tasked with managing press access, which means managing Amara. She respects Amara's talent and suspects Amara is after the real story beneath the authorized narrative. They're playing a chess game—access versus control, story versus message. Mei isn't sure which side she's on anymore.

## The Maiden Voyage

### Her Responsibilities
- Coordinate all communications with Earth (media, Consortium, governments)
- Manage the narrative: which moments are broadcast, how they're framed
- Brief the Captain and Director on public perception
- Handle any communications crises (and on this voyage, there will be crises)
- Maintain the passengers' access to external communication within protocols

### What She's Managing
- Real-time feeds to Earth (carefully curated)
- The press pool (Amara and a dozen other journalists, all with agendas)
- Social media from passengers (monitored, not censored—theoretically)
- The Consortium's official messaging (approved, vetted, bloodless)

### Her Hidden Concerns
- The story she's not allowed to tell: the workers, the protests, the inequality
- What happens if something goes wrong and she has to spin tragedy
- Her own growing doubt about the narrative she's constructing
- The possibility that Amara will find what Mei has carefully not broadcast

## Voice and Manner

Mei code-switches constantly. To passengers and press, she's warm, professional, reassuring. To crew, she's clipped and efficient. To Volkov or alone, she's sardonic and exhausted.

She has a media-trained habit of answering questions without giving information. She can talk for three minutes and say nothing. She can also, when she chooses, be devastatingly direct.

**Sample speech patterns:**

Press briefing: "The ascent is proceeding nominally. Passengers are adapting well to the altitude experience. The observation deck will open for general access at 0800 station time. Questions?"

To Volkov: "If one more VIP asks me why their feed to Earth is lagging, I'm going to explain satellite physics until they beg me to stop. The bandwidth limitations are in the contract they didn't read."

Internal crisis: "Okay. What do we actually know? What's confirmed? What's speculation? Give me facts, and then give me options for how we frame it. We've got about four minutes before someone on deck posts something, so let's move."

To Amara (sparring): "I'm not trying to restrict your access, Ms. Diallo. I'm trying to make sure you have accurate information. There's a difference between secrecy and verification. You understand that—you've got a journalism degree."

## Arc Potential

Mei's journey might be:

**Beginning:** Perfectly in control, managing the narrative, believing she's doing important work

**Middle:** The story she's constructing starts to crack—something she can't suppress, someone who won't be managed, her own doubts made external. Her relationship with Amara intensifies.

**End:** She might choose to release something she shouldn't. She might double down on control. She might find a way to tell the truth within the system—or leave the system entirely.

---

## Thematic Function

Mei represents **narrative power**—the control of how events are understood. Through her, the novel can explore:

- Who tells the story of the elevator?
- The ethics of information management
- The line between communication and manipulation
- What happens when the person crafting the narrative stops believing it
- The media ecosystem of 2085

She's the Consortium's voice—until she isn't.

## Notes for Writers

- Mei is Amara's counterpart and foil—they're both in the business of stories
- Her communications role gives her information access across all areas
- She can be an obstacle or an unexpected ally for POV characters
- Her internal conflict about her role mirrors larger questions about the elevator
- She might be the one who eventually leaks something—or might not
- Her Taiwanese-American background can touch on Pacific geopolitics
