---

## Physical Description

- Tall for an I-Kiribati man, broad-shouldered, once powerfully built
- Now carries the weight of office in his frame—softer, slower
- Dark skin weathered by decades of Pacific sun before politics claimed him
- Hair still black, worn longer than his predecessors—a quiet defiance
- Eyes that have learned to mask everything; when he lets them, they burn
- Hands that remember fishing nets, outrigger paddles, reef work
- Traditional *te biri* (woven armband) worn always, even with Western suits
- Walks with the rolling gait of someone raised on boats, not boardrooms
- Face built for laughter; laughter comes rarely now
- When he smiles for cameras, it's practiced. When he smiles for real, you know.

## Background

### Early Life
- Born on Abaiang Atoll, Gilbert Islands, 2031
- Father was a fisherman; mother a primary school teacher
- Grew up between the reef and the classroom
- Learned traditional navigation from his grandfather—the stars, the swells, the birds
- Childhood memories: the taste of salt, the sound of the *te wa* (canoe) against waves
- First saw Te Rarawa at age 16, when his family relocated for construction work
- The island boy who watched his ocean become a construction site

### Education
- Secondary school in South Tarawa
- Scholarship to University of the South Pacific, Fiji—political science
- Master's degree at Australian National University—international relations
- Thesis: "Sovereignty and Survival: Small Island States in the Age of Extraction"
- Returned home when others with his credentials left
- "I didn't study how to leave. I studied how to stay."

### Early Political Career
- Local council in Tarawa, 2058
- Elected to Parliament (Maneaba ni Maungatabu), 2062
- Minister of Environment and Fisheries, 2067-2071
- Leader of the Opposition, 2071-2077
- Elected President, 2077; re-elected 2081

### The Phoenix Compact Generation
- Teannaki was 16 when President Tebwaa Kairaoi signed the Phoenix Compact (2047)
- His father took a construction job in the anchor city; died in a workplace accident (2054)
- His mother never recovered; she's in a care facility in Tarawa now
- He has spent his entire adult life in the shadow of that signature
- He cannot unsign it. He must live within it. He's determined to reshape it.

## Political Position

### The Impossible Presidency

Teannaki governs a nation that is simultaneously:
- Landlord to the most valuable infrastructure on Earth
- Marginalized minority in its own territorial waters
- Recipient of immense wealth (by Pacific standards)
- Stripped of meaningful sovereignty within the Consortium Zone
- Celebrated as "partner" in Consortium propaganda
- Ignored in Consortium decision-making

### His Approach

- **Strategic patience:** He does not rage publicly; he negotiates relentlessly
- **Institutional memory:** He knows every clause of the Phoenix Compact
- **Coalition building:** Allies with other small island states, Global South nations
- **Cultural revival:** Invested in I-Kiribati language and tradition preservation
- **The long game:** His goal is the 2146 renegotiation; he's building leverage now

### Key Initiatives

- **The Passage Rights Campaign:** Fighting to restore promised I-Kiribati access to the elevator
- **Te Rii ni Banaba:** Quietly supports cultural preservation movement (officially neutral)
- **Diaspora Engagement:** Programs to connect scattered I-Kiribati globally
- **Environmental Legacy Fund:** Pushed for increased Consortium contributions
- **The Witness Protocol:** Ensuring I-Kiribati historians document everything

### Relationship with the Consortium

- Has a non-voting seat on the Advisory Council—he attends every meeting
- Knows he's a symbol they tolerate; uses their need for legitimacy as leverage
- Kenji Murakami treats him with careful respect; Teannaki sees through it
- Henrik Lindqvist barely knows his name; Teannaki remembers every slight
- He plays the grateful host in public. In private, he keeps files.

## The Maiden Voyage

### Why He's Aboard

The maiden voyage is the most significant moment in the elevator's operational history. The President of the host nation must be present—anything else would be a diplomatic catastrophe.

But Teannaki has another reason: **He has never ascended.**

Thirty-eight years since the Compact was signed. Decades watching climbers rise from his nation's waters. The President of the host nation has never been to orbit.

It wasn't oversight. It was deliberate. He refused.

"When my people can ride it, I will ride it."

The maiden voyage changes the calculation:
- This is the most public ascent in history
- Every camera will be watching
- If the President of Kiribati is not aboard, the absence will speak
- If he is aboard, he can speak

He accepts the invitation. First class, of course—they need the optics.

But he has conditions:
- He will address the passengers at the orbital hub
- The I-Kiribati flag will fly alongside the Consortium flag
- A delegation of I-Kiribati citizens will accompany him
- (This last demand was denied. He's still fighting.)

## Psychology

### Core Traits
- Patient to a fault—or patient beyond what his critics can endure
- Deeply proud, but pride is a weapon he wields carefully
- Capable of genuine warmth; reserves it for those who earn it
- Anger that runs hot beneath a cool surface
- Strategic intelligence that casual observers mistake for passivity
- Faith—Christian, as most I-Kiribati are—that he struggles with privately

### Internal Conflicts
- **Complicity vs. Resistance:** Every day he works within the system is a day he legitimizes it
- **Personal loss vs. National duty:** His father died building this. Can he separate the grief from the governance?
- **Hope vs. Realism:** He believes the Compact can be renegotiated. Some days, he's not sure.
- **Rage vs. Strategy:** The anger never leaves. He's just learned to use it.

### What He Tells Himself
- "We survived colonization before. We will survive this."
- "The Compact has an end date. Everything ends."
- "My children will see a different Kiribati."
- "I honor my father by staying, not by leaving."

### What He Can't Face
- That his patience may have cost his people years they didn't have
- That some I-Kiribati see him as collaborator, not liberator
- That his father might have told him to burn it all down
- That he wants to see the stars—and feels guilty for wanting it

## Relationships

### President Tebwaa Kairaoi (Historical)
- The man who signed the Compact
- Dead now (2069), but his shadow is long
- Teannaki refuses to condemn him publicly—"He made an impossible choice"
- Privately: "He could have demanded more. He was afraid."
- Kairaoi's grandchildren live in New Zealand. They don't come back.

### Kenji Murakami
- The Chairman who inherited the system
- Their meetings are rituals of careful respect
- Kenji needs Teannaki's legitimacy; Teannaki needs Kenji's access
- Neither trusts the other; both are right
- Teannaki senses something haunted in Kenji—files it away

### Henrik Lindqvist
- Representative of everything extractive about the orbital economy
- Henrik probably can't locate Kiribati on a map
- Teannaki has studied Henrik's family's mining operations in detail
- They've met twice. Henrik was charming and forgettable.
- Teannaki was neither.

### Miriam Okonkwo
- The architect who made it possible
- Teannaki has complicated feelings: she built the miracle; she also built the wound
- He's read her early papers on tether engineering—brilliant
- He's also read the environmental impact statements she signed off on
- He wants to ask her: "Did you think about us? Did you think about the reef?"
- He's not sure he wants to hear the answer.

### Yusuf Haddad
- They've never met
- But Teannaki knows Yusuf's story—or a version of it
- The workers who built but cannot ride: Teannaki sees them as kin
- If they meet on the voyage, there's recognition. They are both hosts dispossessed.

### His Family
- Wife: Nei Tekarara, teacher, stayed in Tarawa ("One of us should stay grounded")
- Son: Banuera, 24, works for the Diaspora Engagement Office
- Daughter: Teresia, 21, studying environmental science in Auckland—angry at everything, including him
- Mother: Nei Moanna, 78, in care in Tarawa, memory fading—sometimes calls him by his father's name

## The Maiden Voyage Arc

### Act I: Boarding
- Arrives with small delegation: his aide, a cultural advisor, a young I-Kiribati journalist
- The Consortium provides him a luxury suite; he requested economy with his people (denied)
- Boarding ceremonies: he stands with the dignitaries, but his eyes find the lottery winners
- Gives a brief, diplomatic speech. The words are empty. His presence is the message.
- First moment alone: he stands at the window as Te Rarawa shrinks below
- The reef is invisible from this height. The scar is just blue.

### Act II: Early Ascent
- Official functions, careful diplomacy
- Observes the class divisions on the climber with grim recognition
- Encounters Miriam at an event; they exchange careful words
- He asks about the tether's environmental mitigation. She's honest. It's worse than she expected.
- Night observation: he looks for the stars his grandfather taught him
- They're the same. The ocean below is not.

### Act III: Mid-Ascent
- The crisis (whatever form it takes) reveals the fault lines
- Teannaki sees the Consortium's response: the wealthy prioritized, the workers forgotten
- He makes a choice: he goes below decks, to where the lottery winners wait
- Finds Yusuf there. Their conversation is quiet. It means more than any speech.
- He says: "We built this together. They forgot both of us."
- Yusuf: "Did you? Build it?"
- Teannaki: "My father did. He's buried in the platform."

### Act IV: High Altitude
- After the crisis, Teannaki's quiet authority has been noticed
- Amara seeks him out for an interview; he grants it, with conditions
- He speaks on record: about the Compact, about the cost, about what comes next
- Not a polemic—a testimony. The facts, the history, the names.
- He looks at Earth from the high windows. His nation is invisible. It always was, to them.

### Act V: Arrival
- At the orbital hub, he delivers his address
- The Consortium expected gratitude. He gives them something else.
- Not attack—something more dangerous: a vision
- He speaks of the I-Kiribati navigators who crossed the Pacific by stars and waves
- He speaks of what his people gave, and what they were promised, and what they received
- He speaks of 2146—when the Compact expires
- He ends with a traditional blessing, in Gilbertese
- Half the audience doesn't understand. The I-Kiribati watching from Te Rarawa do.
- He has not burned anything down. He has planted something.

## Voice and Perspective

### Narrative Style
- If Teannaki were a POV character, his chapters would be:
  - Measured, observational, with currents of controlled emotion
  - Rich with sensory memory of the islands
  - Attentive to power dynamics—who sits where, who speaks first, who is ignored
  - Occasionally breaks into Gilbertese phrases (translated in context)
  - The patience of a fisherman; the calculations of a diplomat

### Key Motifs
- **The reef:** What was, what was lost, what might return
- **Navigation:** Reading the signs, finding the way, the stars as guides
- **The Compact:** Always present, like a wound that won't heal
- **His father:** The ghost he carries, the debt he's paying
- **The long view:** 2146, always 2146

### Speech Patterns
- Formal in public: diplomatic, careful, every word weighed
- Private: more fluid, occasionally sardonic, flashes of warmth
- When angry: quieter, not louder—the Pacific way
- When moved: slips into Gilbertese, catches himself, sometimes doesn't

---

## Thematic Role

Teannaki embodies the novel's questions about:
- **Who owns the future:** A president without sovereignty in his own waters
- **The cost of progress:** His father's body in the platform
- **Complicity and resistance:** Working within the system that consumed his nation
- **Awe and shadow:** He's going to see the stars. His people mostly can't.
- **What endures:** Kiribati has survived colonization, nuclear testing, climate change. It will survive this.

He is not a victim. He is not a hero. He is a leader doing what leaders do: holding something together long enough to pass it on.

## Notes for Writing

- Never make him naive or purely noble—he's a politician who has made hard choices
- His anger is real but rarely displayed; when it surfaces, it matters
- He carries his culture without performing it for outside audiences
- The relationship with Miriam could be a key secondary thread
- His Act V speech should be earned, not preachy—a culmination, not a lecture
- Consider: does he forgive Kairaoi by the end? Does he forgive himself?
