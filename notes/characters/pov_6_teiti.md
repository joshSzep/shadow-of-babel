- Hands that have done every kind of work—calloused, scarred, still strong
- Moves slowly now but deliberately; arthritis in both knees

## Background

### Early Life
- Born in 2014 on Tarawa atoll, Gilbert Islands
- Daughter of a fisherman and a teacher
- Childhood defined by the sea: fishing, navigation, the *maneaba* gatherings
- Learned traditional navigation from her grandfather—reading stars, currents, birds
- Saw the rising waters take the edges of the islands year by year

### The Phoenix Compact
- Was 33 when the Compact was signed in 2047
- Her husband **Teriki Nakibae** saw it as opportunity—better than watching Tarawa drown
- They moved to the construction platform together with their young son Banuera
- Among the first I-Kiribati workers on what would become Te Rarawa
- She watched the reef she'd visited as a child buried under concrete

### The Construction Years

**Platform Assembly (2047–2055)**
- Worked construction on the anchor platform foundation
- One of few women in the early crews; faced harassment, proved herself
- Specialized in underwater and near-water assembly—her comfort in the sea was invaluable
- Watched her homeland transformed into something unrecognizable

**The Thickening (2055–2068)**
- Teriki was reassigned to high-altitude tether assembly
- Teiti remained ground-side, moved into safety coordination
- Became an advocate for worker conditions; clashed with management repeatedly
- She was the one who organized the first unauthorized memorial after Black Day

**October 2065: Teriki's Death (The Anchor Collapse)**
- Teriki was among 23 workers killed when a subsea anchor reinforcement structure failed
- The collapse occurred 40 meters below the surface during a night shift
- Faulty welds, rushed timelines, ignored safety warnings
- Teriki's diving expertise—his I-Kiribati inheritance—was why he was there
- Teiti received the news at dawn; she had just finished her own shift
- His body was recovered three days later; she buried him in the reef he'd helped destroy
- She wore black for a year; then she wore fury
- She organized the memorial that made the Consortium acknowledge the dead

**The 2071 Crisis**
- Founding leader of the Builders' Union coalition that threatened to halt maintenance
- Stood in the *maneaba* they'd built in the Workers' Quarter and gave the speech that united forty nations of workers
- The Consortium feared her more than anyone else
- When the lottery compromise was announced, she called it "a bead offered for a necklace"
- Refused to endorse it; the Union split; she was quietly sidelined

### The Years Since
- Never left Te Rarawa—where would she go? Tarawa is drowning; Babel is built on her youth
- Raised her grandson **Tokanang** (Banuera's son) after Banuera died of radiation-linked cancer in 2078
- Became a keeper of memory: oral histories, traditional practices, the names of the dead
- Leads *Te Rii ni Banaba*—the underground movement preserving I-Kiribati identity
- Maintains the **Shadow Memorial** in the Workers' Quarter
- Still consulted by the Union, though she officially retired
- Her presence at the maiden voyage was the Union's non-negotiable demand

## Psychology

### Core Traits
- Patience of coral: slow-growing, foundation-building, enduring
- Memory as resistance: she remembers what they want forgotten
- Quiet authority: doesn't need to raise her voice
- Grief carried gracefully: not hidden, not performed
- Practical spirituality: the ancestors are real; the reef is still there in another form
- Holds contradictions: she despises what Babel represents; she is proud of what she built

### Internal Conflicts
- **Loss vs. Continuation:** The reef is dead, but she is alive to remember it
- **Anger vs. Acceptance:** Decades of rage, but rage is exhausting
- **Witness vs. Participant:** Is she here to observe or to act?
- **I-Kiribati vs. Global:** Her people were displaced by a global project; can global solidarity redeem it?

### Fears
- That the I-Kiribati will be forgotten, absorbed, erased
- That her grandson Tokanang will never know what the Phoenix Islands were
- That she'll die before seeing any kind of reckoning
- That her presence on the maiden voyage will be used as propaganda: "See, even they accept it"

### Hopes
- To see the reef from above—to see where it was, even if it's gone
- To speak the names of the dead in a place they were never allowed to go
- To witness for those who cannot witness
- That someone will listen—really listen—to what was lost

## Relationships

### Personal
- **Teriki Nakibae** (husband, deceased October 2065): The love of her life; killed in the Anchor Collapse when a subsea reinforcement structure failed; his death made her who she is
- **Banuera Nakibae** (son, deceased 2078): Lived long enough to see his father's killers flourish
- **Tokanang Nakibae** (grandson, 22): Her reason to continue; brilliant, angry, torn between worlds
- **Her community**: The I-Kiribati of Te Rarawa; perhaps 270,000 people who remember where they came from

### Professional/Political
- **Kofi Mensah** (Union General Secretary): Respects him; thinks he compromises too much
- **Fatima al-Rashid** (Orbital Workers' Collective): Her protégé in a sense; carries the fight upward
- **The Consortium**: They once feared her; now they hope she'll legitimize them with her presence
- **Yusuf Haddad**: They've worked together for years; share the bond of those who built and were betrayed

### On the Climber
- **Miriam Okonkwo**: The architect. Teiti has waited thirty years to look her in the eye
- **Henrik Lindqvist**: The class of people who profited while her people drowned
- **Amara Diallo**: A journalist who might actually tell the truth—or might not
- **Zara Chen-Okafor**: Young, promising, about to be used—Teiti recognizes the pattern
- **President Teannaki Kamoriki**: Her distant cousin—the Kamoriki family is large, scattered across the atolls; they share great-grandparents from Abaiang. They haven't spoken in decades; the Compact stands between them. She thinks he compromised too much; he thinks she never understood the impossible choices.

## The Maiden Voyage Arc

### Act I: Boarding
- Boards with the worker delegation; refuses the VIP treatment offered
- The anchor city she helped build has become something monstrous and miraculous
- Looks at the tether and sees the reef that died for it
- Her presence is noticed; some bow, some avoid her gaze
- First glimpse of the passenger manifest: she knows what contradictions are ascending

### Act II: Early Ascent
- The view of Earth takes her breath: she sees the atolls of her childhood
- Gathers with the eleven other I-Kiribati aboard (twelve total, including her); they hold a quiet ceremony
- Workers from other nations seek her blessing; she gives it, feeling the weight
- First encounter with the VIP deck: a corporate reception she attends to observe
- Watches Zara being displayed like a trophy; recognizes exploitation wearing scholarship's face

### Act III: Mid-Ascent
- The confrontation she's been waiting for: she approaches Miriam
- Not with anger—with questions. "Did you know what would be destroyed? Did you care?"
- Miriam has no good answers; Teiti didn't expect any
- The conversation is not closure; it is acknowledgment
- Parallel: she observes the Miriam-Yusuf confrontation, sees both sides, grieves for both

### Act IV: High Altitude
- Near-weightlessness: her arthritic body floats free for the first time in decades
- The overview effect: Earth is whole, beautiful, wounded
- She can see where the Phoenix Islands were—or where they weren't; the reef is invisible from here
- A ceremony: she speaks the names of the dead aloud, including Teriki's, in a place he was denied
- Conversations with other passengers: what did you sacrifice? What was sacrificed for you?

### Act V: Arrival
- The Hub is magnificent and terrible—the future, built on erasure
- She speaks at the arrival ceremony; her words are not what the Consortium wanted
- Not a denunciation—a witnessing. "This is what was. This is what is. You must carry both."
- Decides whether to return to Earth or remain—either choice is meaningful
- Final image: looking at Earth, speaking to Teriki, promising to remember

## Voice and Style

### Interior Monologue
- Rhythmic, patient, tied to natural cycles (tides, seasons, stars)
- Metaphors from the sea, navigation, traditional construction
- Memory woven through present: the past is never past
- Grief worn like a garment, not a wound
- Wisdom without detachment—she is still angry, still fighting

### Dialogue
- Speaks carefully; every word considered
- Uses silence powerfully
- Can be devastating without raising her voice
- Shifts between Gilbertese (with I-Kiribati), English (with others), and the pidgin of the workers' quarters
- When she tells a story, the room listens

### Sample Internal Passage

*The reef is down there somewhere. Not the reef—the ghost of it. Concrete and carbon now, anchor for humanity's longest ladder. She had swum those waters as a girl, when the fish were still so thick you could walk on their backs, as her grandfather claimed. She never believed him until the fish were gone and she'd have believed anything to have them back. Now she rises above where they once swam, and the elevator hums beneath her like a heartbeat, and she wonders if this is what dying feels like—ascending while everything you loved stays below.*

## Key Scenes to Write

1. **The boarding sequence**: Refusing VIP status; entering with workers
2. **The ceremony with I-Kiribati workers**: Holding tradition in a steel vessel
3. **The confrontation with Miriam**: Not accusation—excavation
4. **Observing Zara**: Recognizing a young person being exploited
5. **The overview moment**: Seeing the absent reef from above
6. **Speaking the names**: A ritual of witnessing in zero-gravity
7. **The arrival speech**: What she says to the world, and why it matters
8. **Final decision**: Stay or return—and what either means

---

## Thematic Role

Teiti represents **the cost of miracles**. She is what was sacrificed to build heaven—not destroyed, but displaced, transformed, made to witness. Her journey asks:

- What do we owe those whose world was erased for our future?
- Can those who paid the price witness the result without blessing it?
- Is survival resistance, or is it accommodation?
- What does it mean to remember when everyone wants to forget?

She is not a victim—she is an elder, a leader, a builder. She created Babel too. That's what makes her presence so uncomfortable for everyone aboard.

She carries the reef with her. She will make them see it.

## Cultural Notes

### Language
- **Gilbertese** (also called Kiribati): Her first language; she thinks in it
- Key terms she uses:
  - *Maneaba*: Traditional meeting house; a place of community and decision
  - *Te Rii ni Banaba*: "The Spine of the Ocean"—the cultural preservation movement
  - *Te Rarawa*: "The Arrival"—the city's official name
  - *Te Mate*: "The Death"—what elders call it privately

### Traditional Knowledge
- Navigation by stars, waves, and birds (though she hasn't practiced in decades)
- Oral history preservation—she is a keeper of genealogies and stories
- The *maneaba* protocols of speaking and listening
- Traditional weaving (she still makes mats; they remind her of who she is)

### The Weight of Representation
- She knows she's seen as representative of all I-Kiribati
- She rejects this—she speaks for herself, and for the dead, but not for a nation
- Yet she cannot escape the symbolism; she wields it carefully
- Her presence is a political fact, whether she wants it to be or not

## Connection to Other POVs

| Character | Connection | Tension |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Miriam** | Architect and displaced—creator and cost | "Did you know? Did you care?" |
| **Yusuf** | Fellow builder, fellow betrayed, different losses | Solidarity and shared rage |
| **Zara** | Youth being used as Teiti once was; potential mentorship | "Don't let them make you a symbol" |
| **Henrik** | The class that profited from her loss | Cold observation; he is data, not enemy |
| **Amara** | Potential truth-teller—or propagandist | "What story will you tell? Whose story?" |

---

## The Question She Carries

Teiti's core question is not "Can I forgive?" but **"Can I be witnessed?"**

She doesn't need absolution from Miriam or anyone else. She needs acknowledgment. She needs the passengers, the Consortium, the world to say: *We see what was destroyed. We remember.*

Her arc is not about personal healing—it's about collective memory. If she can make them remember, even one of them, then her voyage means something.

If they forget anyway, she will have witnessed alone. And that, too, will have to be enough.
