# The Anchor City: Te Rarawa

## Overview

**Te Rarawa** (Gilbertese: "The Arrival") is humanity's gateway to the heavens—a purpose-built megacity rising from the central Pacific, constructed on what was once the Phoenix Islands Protected Area. It exists as both miracle and contradiction: a monument to human achievement surrounded by the human cost of achieving it.

The city's name was chosen by the Republic of Kiribati, the host nation, though the I-Kiribati people sometimes call it by another name in private: **Te Mate** ("The Death")—referring to what was sacrificed for its construction.

## Location

**Coordinates:** 3°S, 171°W — in the heart of what was once the Phoenix Islands, central Pacific Ocean

The anchor point sits almost exactly on the equator, on a massive artificial platform built over the submerged reef systems that once made this region one of Earth's last pristine marine ecosystems. The original Phoenix Islands—Kanton, Enderbury, Birnie, McKean, Rawaki, Manra, Orona, and Nikumaroro—have been variously submerged, landfilled, or incorporated into the expanded platform city.

### Why This Location

- **Equatorial positioning**: Maximum rotational velocity for orbital mechanics
- **Deep Pacific**: Far from major population centers, reducing NIMBYism
- **Existing sovereignty**: Kiribati's territorial waters provided legal framework
- **Small population**: The Phoenix Islands were nearly uninhabited (only ~20 residents on Kanton)
- **Political vulnerability**: A small island nation desperate for climate adaptation funds

### The Faustian Bargain

In 2047, the Republic of Kiribati signed the **Phoenix Compact**—a 99-year lease granting the nascent Babel Consortium sovereign authority over the Phoenix Islands Exclusive Economic Zone in exchange for:

- $50 billion upfront (equivalent to 500 years of Kiribati's GDP)
- Guaranteed passage rights for I-Kiribati citizens (later renegotiated, reduced, disputed)
- Climate adaptation funding for the Gilbert Islands
- Employment preferences for Kiribati citizens (honored in letter, violated in spirit)
- A permanent seat on the Consortium Advisory Council (non-voting)

The deal was controversial from the start. President Tebwaa Kairaoi, who signed it, is remembered as either a visionary who saved his nation or a traitor who sold the sea.

## The Lost Ecosystem

### What Was Destroyed

The Phoenix Islands Protected Area (PIPA), established in 2008, was once the largest marine protected area in the Pacific—408,250 km² of pristine ocean. It was home to:

- Over 500 species of reef fish
- 120 species of coral, many found nowhere else
- Endangered sea turtles, giant clams, and manta rays
- Pristine deep-sea ecosystems untouched by industrial fishing
- Archaeological sites of ancient Polynesian settlement

### The Environmental Reckoning

The construction of Te Rarawa required:

- Dredging and landfilling that destroyed 200+ km² of reef
- Dumping of construction waste into the surrounding ocean
- Light and noise pollution that disrupted migratory patterns
- Thermal pollution from industrial processes
- The extinction of at least 14 endemic species (documented; true number unknown)

The Consortium maintains an "Environmental Legacy Fund" and a small "living reef museum" near the Ascension District. Critics call it a gravestone.

## Physical Structure

### The Tether Base
- The elevator's anchor point is a massive engineering complex
- Carbon-composite foundations reaching deep into bedrock or ocean floor
- Constant low vibration from the tether's tension
- Security perimeter extends kilometers in every direction
- The tether rises from the center like a blade of light cutting the sky

### Urban Rings

**Inner Ring: The Ascension District**
- Terminals, boarding facilities, elite hotels
- Corporate headquarters of orbital companies
- Pristine, climate-controlled, heavily secured
- Architecture: soaring glass, carbon fiber, living walls
- Population: transient wealthy, executives, diplomats

**Second Ring: The Service Zone**
- Worker housing, logistics centers, maintenance facilities
- Where the elevator's support staff lives
- Functional architecture, dense population
- 24-hour activity supporting the endless operations
- Many residents helped build Babel but cannot afford to ride it

**Outer Rings: The Sprawl**
- Informal settlements, economic migrants, protest camps
- People drawn by the dream of ascent
- Shanty markets selling "orbital goods" (mostly counterfeit)
- Underground economies, information brokers, activists
- The further out, the more the city resembles any struggling megacity

---

## Climate and Atmosphere

- Equatorial heat and humidity, intensified by urban heat island effect
- The Pacific trades provide some relief, but the platform traps heat
- Monsoon seasons create dramatic visual contrasts; flooding in the outer rings
- The tether visible from everywhere, day and night
- At night, the climbers appear as slow-moving stars ascending the thread
- Smog from the outer rings occasionally obscures the base
- The wealthy districts maintain artificial climate bubbles
- The smell of the sea—once pristine—now carries industrial notes

### The Water Problem

Te Rarawa's greatest irony: a city surrounded by ocean, perpetually short of fresh water.

- Desalination plants run constantly
- Water is rationed in the outer rings
- The wealthy have unlimited supply; the poor buy it by the liter
- "Water riots" have occurred during desalination failures
- Some I-Kiribati elders remember when the rain was enough

---

## The I-Kiribati Presence

### A Host Nation in Its Own Home

Kiribati citizens have a complex relationship with Te Rarawa:

**Legal Status**
- Guaranteed residency rights in the Consortium Zone
- Preferential hiring (theoretically) for Consortium jobs
- Free passage to the Gilbert Islands (their ancestral home, 3,000 km away)
- Advisory representation on Consortium governance (non-binding)

**Reality**
- Most I-Kiribati work service jobs: cleaning, food service, minor maintenance
- Traditional fishing is now illegal in the "safety exclusion zone"
- The Gilbertese language is rarely spoken in the Ascension District
- Cultural practices are performed for tourists, not lived
- Young I-Kiribati face a choice: assimilate or leave

**The Diaspora**
- ~60% of ethnic Kiribati now live in the Gilbert Islands
- ~25% in Te Rarawa, mostly in the Service Zone
- ~15% scattered globally (New Zealand, Fiji, Australia)
- Remittances from Te Rarawa workers support families on Tarawa

**Cultural Survival**
- The *maneaba* (traditional meeting house) tradition survives in modified form
- Some elders maintain traditional navigation knowledge
- The Kiribati language is taught in community schools
- *Te Rii ni Banaba* ("The Spine of the Ocean")—an underground movement seeking to preserve I-Kiribati identity

## Sensory Details

### Sounds
- Constant low hum from the tether infrastructure
- Multilingual announcements in transit hubs
- Protest chants from the outer rings (sometimes audible in the inner)
- The thrum of cargo drones
- Temple bells, call to prayer, church bells—the city is spiritually diverse

### Smells
- Ozone near the tether base
- Street food from a hundred cultures in the service zones
- Antiseptic cleanliness in the boarding terminals
- Diesel and sweat in the outer sprawl
- Incense from shrines built facing the elevator

### Sights
- The tether dominates every view, a vertical horizon
- Holographic advertisements in multiple languages
- Security drones patrolling the inner rings
- The contrast between gleaming terminals and corrugated shelters
- The queue: sometimes visible for kilometers, people waiting for lottery tickets

---

## Economy

### Primary Industries
- Elevator operations and maintenance
- Orbital logistics and cargo handling
- Tourism (for those who can afford it)
- Support services for the transient elite
- Black markets for everything else

### The Lottery System
- A fraction of seats are allocated by global lottery
- Millions enter; hundreds ascend
- Lottery winners become instant celebrities
- Fraud, scalping, and corruption surround the system
- Some winners sell their tickets; others are never seen again

### Labor
- Construction workers who built the elevator remain in the city
- Many were promised passage that never came
- Skilled maintenance work is respected but not rewarded with access
- Union movements, strikes, and negotiations are constant
- "We built heaven and they locked the gate"

---

## Security and Control

- The inner ring is effectively a separate jurisdiction
- Private security forces with quasi-military authority
- Biometric checkpoints between rings
- Surveillance is total in the Ascension District
- The outer rings are more chaotic, less controlled
- Protests are tolerated outside; suppressed if they approach the base

---

## Spiritual and Cultural Life

The elevator has become a religious and philosophical symbol:

- **New faiths** have emerged around the ascent
- **Traditional religions** incorporate the tower into their cosmology
- **Secular pilgrims** come simply to witness
- **Shrines and temples** face the tether
- **The Babel Churches**: syncretic movements believing ascent is spiritual liberation
- **The Grounded**: those who refuse to ascend on principle, believing humanity should remain earthbound
