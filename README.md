## Core Premise

The story covers the **first major public ascent** of the Babel Elevator—humanity's greatest engineered structure, a 36,000 km tether connecting Earth to orbit. Billions watch as a climber carries dignitaries, workers, journalists, students, activists, and people with secrets toward the stars.

The tension is not disaster or sabotage. It is **moral, political, personal, and philosophical**—what the elevator represents, what it reveals about us, what it costs.

## Central Questions

- Who owns the future when the future is above the sky?
- Does ambition justify inequality?
- What do people see when they rise above their world?
- Is awe enough to bind humanity together?
- What happens when a miracle exposes our fractures?
- Is Babel a symbol of unity or a monument to division?
