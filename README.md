# Shadow of Babel

![Shadow of Babel Cover](cover.png)

## Overview

Shadow of Babel is a near future science fiction epic about ambition, inequality, and the cost of building a technological marvel that changes the world in uneven ways. The story centers on the construction and control of the first true space elevator. It is a triumph of engineering that promises open access to orbit, but in practice becomes a gatekeeper that divides humanity by those who rise and those who remain in its growing shadow.

Told through multiple points of view, the novel explores the human consequences of global systems. Politicians, engineers, workers, activists, and the people who live at the base of the tower each carry a piece of the truth. Their lives collide as pressure builds around the elevator, revealing the gap between what humanity can build and what it can sustain.

Shadow of Babel aims to deliver a grounded, character driven story inside a sweeping hard sci fi setting. The goal is to create a novel that feels urgent, contemporary, and emotionally honest while maintaining scientific credibility and world scale tension.

## Author

Written by Joshua Szepietowski. I write hard sci fi that mixes human complexity with ambitious near future concepts. I aim for stories that entertain, challenge, and leave readers thinking about the world they live in.

If you are a publishing professional who finds this project interesting, I would welcome a conversation.
